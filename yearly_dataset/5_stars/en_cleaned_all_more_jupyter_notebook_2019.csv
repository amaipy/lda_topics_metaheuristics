174942404,LeadingIndiaAI/Wake-UP-word-detection,"Wake-up-word(WUW)system is an emerging development in recent times. Voice interaction with systems have made life ease and aids in multi-tasking. Apple, Google, Microsoft, Amazon have developed a custom wake-word engine, which are addressed by words such as ‚ÄòHey Siri‚Äô. ‚ÄòOk Google‚Äô, ‚ÄòCortana‚Äô, ‚ÄòAlexa‚Äô. Our project focuses initially only detection and response to a customized wake-up command. The wake-up command used is ‚ÄúGOLUMOLU‚Äù. A wake-up-word detection system search for specific word and reads the word, where it rejects all other words, phrases and sounds. WUW system needs only less memory space, low computational cost and high precision. Artificial Neural Networks(ANN) have reduced the complexity, computational time, latency, thus the efficiency of system has improved. Deep learning has improved the efficiency of automatic speech recognition(SR), where wake word detection is a subset of SR but unlike keyword spotting and voice recognition. A deep learning RNN model is used for the training of the network. RNN are specifically used in case of temporal sequence data and has the ability to process data of different length but of same dimension. For training a model, labelled dataset is needed. We generated three forms of data: golumolu, negative and background. Such that, the model learns circumspectly and attentively detects when specific word found. To start communication with system, the wake word should be delivered. The main task of WUW detection system is to detect the speech, to identify WUW words among spoken words, to check whether the word spoken in altering context.",2020-07-17T06:31:48Z,wake word wuw emerge development time voice interaction life ease aid multi tasking apple google microsoft amazon develop custom wake word engine address word hey siri google cortana alexa focus initially detection response customize wake command wake command golumolu wake word detection search specific word read word reject word phrase sound wuw memory space computational cost precision artificial neural_network ann reduce complexity computational time latency efficiency deep_learning efficiency automatic speech_recognition wake word detection subset keyword spot voice recognition deep_learning rnn model training network rnn temporal sequence data ability process data dimension train model label dataset generate form data golumolu negative background model learn circumspectly attentively detect specific word communication wake word deliver main task wuw detection detect speech identify wuw word speak word check word speak alter context,word wake wuw

183293905,shishirdas/Rain-Fall_Data_Analysis_Using_Data_Science,"Context Rainfall is very crucial things for any types of agricultural task. Climate related data is important to analyse agricultural and crop seeding related field, where those data can be used to show the predict the rainfall in different season also for different types of crops. Developed application can be found from http://ml.bigalogy.com/ Paper: http://dspace.uiu.ac.bd/handle/52243/178 Abstract Mankind have been attempting to predict the weather from prehistory. For good reason for knowing when to plant crops, when to build and when to prepare for drought and flood. In a nation such as Bangladesh being able to predict the weather, especially rainfall has never been so vitally important. The proposed research work pursues to produce prediction model on rainfall using the machine learning algorithms. The base data for this work has been collected from Bangladesh Meteorological Department. It is mainly focused on the development of models for long term rainfall prediction of Bangladesh divisions and districts (Weather Stations). Rainfall prediction is very important for the Bangladesh economy and day to day life. Scarcity or heavy - both rainfall effects rural and urban life to a great extent with the changing pattern of the climate. Unusual rainfall and long lasting rainy season is a great factor to take account into. We want to see whether too much unusual behavior is taking place another pattern resulting new clamatorial description. As agriculture is dependent on rain and heavy rainfall caused flood frequently leading to great loss to crops, rainfall is a very complex phenomenon which is dependent on various atmospheric, oceanic and geographical parameters. The relationship between these parameters and rainfall is unstable. Beside this changing behavior of clamatorial facts making the existing meteorological forecasting less usable to the users.  Initially linear regression models were developed for monthly rainfall prediction of station and national level as per day month year. Here humidity, temperatures & wind parameters are used as predictors. The study is further extended by developing another popular regression analysis algorithm named Random Forest Regression. After then, few other classification algorithms have been used for model building, training and prediction. Those are Naive Bayes Classification, Decision Tree Classification (Entropy and Gini) and Random Forest Classification. In all model building and training predictor parameters were Station, Year, Month and Day. As the effect of rainfall affecting parameters is embedded in rainfall, rainfall was the label or dependent variable in these models. The developed and trained model is capable of predicting rainfall in advance for a month of a given year for a given area (for area we used here are the stations (weather parameters values are measured by Bangladesh Meteorological Department). The accuracy of rainfall estimation is above 65%. Accuracy percentage varies from algorithm to algorithm.  Two regression analysis and three classification analysis models has been developed for rainfall prediction of 33 Bangladeshi weather station. Apache Spark library has been used for machine library in Scala programming language. The main idea behind the use of classification and regression analysis is to see the comparative difference between types of algorithms prediction output and the predictability along with usability.  This thesis is a contribution to the effort of rainfall prediction within Bangladesh. It takes the strategy of applying machine learning models to historical weather data gathered in Bangladesh. As part of this work, a web-based software application was written using Apache Spark, Scala and HighCharts to demonstrate rainfall prediction using multiple machine learning models. Models are successively improved with the rainfall prediction accuracy.  Content The given data has weather station and year wise monthly rainfall data of Bangladesh.

186919823,Jonathandeventer/master-thesis-DCDT,"In recent years, community detection has received increased attention thanks to its wide range of applications in many fields. While at first most techniques were focused on discovering communities in static networks, lately the research community‚Äôs focus has shifted toward methods that can detect meaningful substructures in evolving networks because of their high relevance in real-life problems. This thesis explores the current availability of empirical comparative studies of dynamic methods and also provides its own qualitative and quantitative comparison with the aim of gaining more insight in the performance of available algorithms that are expected to perform well in the context of social community detection. The qualitative comparison includes 13 algorithms, namely D-GT, Extended BGL, TILES, AFOCS, HOCTracker, OLCPM, DOCET, LabelRankT, FacetNet, DYNMOGA, DEMON and iLCD. The empirical analysis compares TILES, HOCTracker, OLCPM, DEMON and iLCD on synthetic RDyn graphs and the real graph, DBLP. In addition to the results of the empirical and qualitative results of the analysis, the thesis‚Äôs value lies in its wide coverage of the dynamic community detection problem.

With the increased use of IoT infrastructure in every domain, threats and attacks in these infrastructures are also growing commensurately. Denial of Service, Data Type Probing, Malicious Control, Malicious Operation, Scan, Spying and Wrong Setup are such attacks and anomalies which can cause an IoT system failure. In this paper, performances of several machine learning models have been compared to predict attacks and anomalies on the IoT systems accurately. The machine learning (ML) algorithms that have been used here are Logistic Regression (LR), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Decision Tree (DT), Random Forest (RF), and Artificial Neural Network (ANN). The evaluation metrics used in the comparison of performance are accuracy, precision, recall, f1 score, and area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve. The system obtained 99.4% test accuracy for Decision Tree, Random Forest, and ANN. Though these techniques have the same accuracy, other metrics prove that Random Forest performs comparatively better.",2021-04-09T05:04:31Z,attack anomaly_detection internet iot infrastructure rise concern domain iot increase iot infrastructure domain threat attack infrastructure grow commensurately denial service data type probing malicious control malicious operation scan spy wrong setup attack anomalie iot failure paper performance machine_learning model compare predict attack anomaly iot accurately machine_learning ml logistic_regression support_vector machine svm decision_tree dt random_forest rf artificial neural_network ann evaluation metric comparison performance accuracy precision recall f1 score receiver operate characteristic curve accuracy decision_tree random_forest ann technique accuracy metric prove random_forest perform comparatively,accuracy random_forest attack iot infrastructure

However, current procedures followed by human inspectors demand long inspection times to examine large and difficult to access bridges. To address these limitations, we investigate a computer vision‚Äêbased approach that employs SIFT keypoint matching on collected images of defects against a pre-existing reconstructed 3D point cloud of the bridge. We also investigate methods of reducing computation time with ML-based and conventional CV methods of segmentation to eliminate redundant keypoints.

199842680,Garima13a/MNIST_GAN,"In this notebook, we'll be building a generative adversarial network (GAN) trained on the MNIST dataset. From this, we'll be able to generate new handwritten digits!  GANs were first reported on in 2014 from Ian Goodfellow and others in Yoshua Bengio's lab. Since then, GANs have exploded in popularity. Here are a few examples to check out:  Pix2Pix CycleGAN & Pix2Pix in PyTorch, Jun-Yan Zhu A list of generative models The idea behind GANs is that you have two networks, a generator  ùê∫  and a discriminator  ùê∑ , competing against each other. The generator makes ""fake"" data to pass to the discriminator. The discriminator also sees real training data and predicts if the data it's received is real or fake.  The generator is trained to fool the discriminator, it wants to output data that looks as close as possible to real, training data. The discriminator is a classifier that is trained to figure out which data is real and which is fake. What ends up happening is that the generator learns to make data that is indistinguishable from real data to the discriminator.   The general structure of a GAN is shown in the diagram above, using MNIST images as data. The latent sample is a random vector that the generator uses to construct its fake images. This is often called a latent vector and that vector space is called latent space. As the generator trains, it figures out how to map latent vectors to recognizable images that can fool the discriminator.  If you're interested in generating only new images, you can throw out the discriminator after training. In this notebook, I'll show you how to define and train these adversarial networks in PyTorch and generate new images!",2021-05-13T07:39:40Z,build generative_adversarial network gan train mnist dataset generate handwritten_digit gan report ian goodfellow yoshua bengio lab gan explode popularity check pix2pix cyclegan pix2pix pytorch jun yan zhu list generative model idea gan network generator discriminator compete generator fake data pass discriminator discriminator real training data predict data receive real fake generator train fool discriminator output data close real training data discriminator classifier train figure data real fake happen generator learn data indistinguishable real data discriminator structure gan diagram mnist image data latent random vector generator construct fake image call latent vector vector space call latent space generator train figure map latent vector recognizable image fool discriminator generate image throw discriminator training define train adversarial_network pytorch generate image,real gan fake generator vector latent discriminator

This segmentation of images helps the doctors in exploring the internal anatomy. There are many existing techniques based on cross-section images and X-Ray like Computed Tomography (CT), or Magnetic Resonance Imaging, or others like Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography (SPECT), Positron Emission Tomography (PET), or ultrasound. The Computed Tomography images are complex, so the identification as well as the localization of organs manually is interminable and hard.

This project aims to help make that decision. Vader sentiment analysis was implemented on tweets to compute a daily sentiment score. From historical stock data the difference between Tesla opening price and the prior day‚Äôs closing price was computed and used as the endogenous variable in an ARIMAX time series model with daily sentiment as an exogenous variable. This final model was able to predict that the Tesla stock will open the next day at a higher price than today‚Äôs closing price with 58.8% precision.",2021-06-14T14:17:56Z,watch telsa stock decide buy stock close jump tomorrow decision aim decision vader sentiment_analysis tweet compute daily sentiment score historical stock data difference tesla price prior day closing price compute endogenous variable arimax time_series model daily sentiment exogenous variable model predict tesla stock day price closing price precision,sentiment price stock daily decision compute tesla closing

Thanks to the ARGO database collected by buoys making vertical surveys, one has precise but sparse knowledge of the vertical thermal structure of the ocean. The objective of this project is to develop a methodology to statistically combine additional information to obtain a 3D time series sufficiently resolved horizontally and vertically to follow the eddies. It is based on a regression classification method that allows both to classify the temperature profiles and to propose a linear model between the satellite observations and the information of the buoys according to its label.",2021-01-28T11:28:49Z,satellite surface signature temperature spatial frequency horizontal resolution vertical resolution argo database collect buoy vertical survey precise sparse knowledge vertical thermal structure ocean objective develop methodology statistically combine additional information 3d time_series resolve horizontally vertically follow eddy regression classification method classify temperature profile propose linear model satellite observation information buoy label,temperature resolution satellite buoy vertical

Calendar life data was generated by applying galvanostatic charge/discharge cycle loads at different storage temperature (35¬∞C and 60¬∞C) and conditions (fully-discharged and fully-charged). The data was obtained at various C-rates for duration of 10 months at one-month intervals. The wininng model, Random Forest (RF), has achieved a R2 score of 99.98% and a mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.14% over test data, confirming the ability of RF to capture input-output dependency.

Today‚Äôs algorithms accomplish tasks that until recently only expert humans could perform. As it relates to finance, this is an exciting time to adopt a disruptive technology that will transform how everyone invests for generations.  Models that explain the returns of individual stocks generally use company and stock characteristics, e.g., the market prices of financial instruments and companies‚Äô accounting data. These characteristics can also be used to predict expected stock returns out-of-sample. Most studies use simple linear models to form these predictions [1] or [2]. An increasing body of academic literature documents that more sophisticated tools from the Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) repertoire, which allow for nonlinear predictor interactions, can improve the stock return forecasts [3], [4] or [5].  The main goal of this project is to investigate whether modern DL techniques can be utilized to more efficiently predict the movements of the stock market. Specifically, we train a LSTM neural network with time series price-volume data and compare its out-of-sample return predictability with the performance of a simple logistic regression (our baseline model).",2021-06-18T22:30:49Z,stanford artificial_intelligence change virtually aspect life accomplish task expert human perform finance exciting time adopt disruptive technology transform invest generation model explain return individual stock company stock characteristic e_g market price financial instrument company account data characteristic predict expect stock return study linear model form prediction increase body academic literature document sophisticated tool machine_learning ml deep_learning dl repertoire nonlinear predictor interaction stock return forecast main goal investigate modern dl technique utilize efficiently predict movement stock_market train lstm neural_network time_series price volume data compare return predictability performance logistic_regression baseline model,stock return characteristic

Benjamin Graham and Warren Buffett Model Step 1: Filter out all companies with sales less than Rs 250 cr.  Companies with sales lower than this are very small companies and might not have the business stability  and access to finance that is required for a safe investment. This eliminates the basic business risk.  Step 2: Filter out all companies with debt to equity greater than 30%.  Companies with low leverage are safer.  Step 3: Filter out all companies with interest coverage ratio of less than 4.  Companies with high interest coverage ratio have a highly reduced bankruptcy risk.  Step 4: Filter out all companies with ROE less than 15%  since they are earning less than their cost of capital. High ROE companies have a robust business model,  which generates increased earnings for the company typically.  Step 5: Filter out all companies with PE ratio greater than 25  since they are too expensive even for a high-quality company. This enables us to pick companies which are  relatively cheaper as against their actual value. He points out that applying these filters enables us to  reduce and even eliminate a lot of fundamental risks while ensuring a robust business model, strong  earning potential and a good buying price.

Alzheimer‚Äôs is one of kind and fatal. The early detection of Alzheimer‚Äôs Disease because of it‚Äôs progressive risk and patients all around the world. Early detection of AD is promising as it can help lot of patients to predetermine the condition they may face in future. AD being progressive, can be prevented if detected early. On worse stage, the curing of this disease is very difficult and expensive. So, by analyzing the consequences of AD, we can make use of Artificial intelligence technology by using MRI scanned images to classify the patients if they may or may not have AD in future. Using of Bio-inspired algorithm can maximize the result and accuracy for this purpose. After comparing the results of the various AI technologies, CSA came to be the best approach, using it with ML algorithms.

Our approach consists of a two-phase deep learning architecture that operates purely on the natural language descriptions of issues. The first phase of our approach learns high dimensional sentence embeddings from hundreds of thousands of descriptions extracted from software vulnerabilities listed in the CVE database and issue descriptions extracted from open source projects using an unsupervised learning process. The second phase then utilizes this semantic ontology of embeddings to train a deep convolutional neural network capable of predicting whether a given issue contains security- related information.",2021-04-15T10:58:57Z,call securereqnet automatically identify issue bug issue tracking security content careful attention phase deep_learning architecture operate purely natural_language description issue phase learn dimensional sentence embedding description extract software vulnerability list cve database issue description extract unsupervised learning process phase utilize semantic ontology embedding train deep convolutional_neural network capable predict issue security information,security issue description phase
