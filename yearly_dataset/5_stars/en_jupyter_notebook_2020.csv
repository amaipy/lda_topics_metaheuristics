The PCA can greatly simplify the problem of modelling the yield curve by massively reducing its dimensionality to a small set of uncorrelated features. It Ô¨Ånds several applications in Ô¨Ånance and in the Ô¨Åxed income particularly from risk management to trade recommendation. After selecting a subset of Principal Components (PCs), this paper Ô¨Årst analyzes their nature in comparison to the original rates and the implications in terms of information retained and lost. Then the time-series characteristics of each PC are studied and, when possible, Auto-Regressive Moving-Average (ARMA) models will be Ô¨Åtted on the data. One hundred observations of the original dataset are set aside as a test set to evaluate the predictive power of these models. Eventually, further analyses are performed on the PCs to evaluate the presence of heteroscedasticity and GARCH-ARCH models are Ô¨Åtted when possible. Tests are performed on the Ô¨Åtted coeÔ¨Écient to investigate the real nature of the conditional variance process.",2021-05-27T06:00:45Z,en

237788413,bideeen/Building-A-Trading-Strategy-With-Python,"trading strategy is a fixed plan to go long or short in markets,  there are two common trading strategies: the momentum strategy and the reversion strategy. Firstly, the momentum strategy is also called divergence or trend trading. When you follow this strategy, you do so because you believe the movement of a quantity will continue in its current direction. Stated differently, you believe that stocks have momentum or upward or downward trends, that you can detect and exploit. Some examples of this strategy are the moving average crossover, the dual moving average crossover, and turtle trading:  The moving average crossover is when the price of an asset moves from one side of a moving average to the other. This crossover represents a change in momentum and can be used as a point of making the decision to enter or exit the market. You‚Äôll see an example of this strategy, which is the ‚Äúhello world‚Äù of quantitative trading later on in this tutorial. The dual moving average crossover occurs when a short-term average crosses a long-term average. This signal is used to identify that momentum is shifting in the direction of the short-term average. A buy signal is generated when the short-term average crosses the long-term average and rises above it, while a sell signal is triggered by a short-term average crossing long-term average and falling below it. Turtle trading is a popular trend following strategy that was initially taught by Richard Dennis. The basic strategy is to buy futures on a 20-day high and sell on a 20-day low.  Secondly, the reversion strategy, which is also known as convergence or cycle trading. This strategy departs from the belief that the movement of a quantity will eventually reverse. This might seem a little bit abstract, but will not be so anymore when you take the example. Take a look at the mean reversion strategy, where you actually believe that stocks return to their mean and that you can exploit when it deviates from that mean.  That already sounds a whole lot more practical, right?  Another example of this strategy, besides the mean reversion strategy, is the pairs trading mean-reversion, which is similar to the mean reversion strategy. Whereas the mean reversion strategy basically stated that stocks return to their mean, the pairs trading strategy extends this and states that if two stocks can be identified that have a relatively high correlation, the change in the difference in price between the two stocks can be used to signal trading events if one of the two moves out of correlation with the other. That means that if the correlation between two stocks has decreased, the stock with the higher price can be considered to be in a short position. It should be sold because the higher-priced stock will return to the mean. The lower-priced stock, on the other hand, will be in a long position because the price will rise as the correlation will return to normal.  Besides these two most frequent strategies, there are also other ones that you might come across once in a while, such as the forecasting strategy, which attempts to predict the direction or value of a stock, in this case, in subsequent future time periods based on certain historical factors. There‚Äôs also the High-Frequency Trading (HFT) strategy, which exploits the sub-millisecond market microstructure.  That‚Äôs all music for the future for now; Let‚Äôs focus on developing your first trading strategy for now!  A Simple Trading Strategy As you read above, you‚Äôll start with the ‚Äúhello world‚Äù of quantitative trading: the moving average crossover. The strategy that you‚Äôll be developing is simple: you create two separate Simple Moving Averages (SMA) of a time series with differing lookback periods, let‚Äôs say, 40 days and 100 days. If the short moving average exceeds the long moving average then you go long, if the long moving average exceeds the short moving average then you exit.  Remember that when you go long, you think that the stock price will go up and will sell at a higher price in the future (= buy signal); When you go short, you sell your stock, expecting that you can buy it back at a lower price and realize a profit (= sell signal).  This simple strategy might seem quite complex when you‚Äôre just starting out, but let‚Äôs take this step by step:  First define your two different lookback periods: a short window and a long window. You set up two variables and assign one integer per variable. Make sure that the integer that you assign to the short window is shorter than the integer that you assign to the long window variable! Next, make an empty signals DataFrame, but do make sure to copy the index of your aapl data so that you can start calculating the daily buy or sell signal for your aapl data. Create a column in your empty signals DataFrame that is named signal and initialize it by setting the value for all rows in this column to 0.0. After the preparatory work, it‚Äôs time to create the set of short and long simple moving averages over the respective long and short time windows. Make use of the rolling() function to start your rolling window calculations: within the function, specify the window and the min_period, and set the center argument. In practice, this will result in a rolling() function to which you have passed either short_window or long_window, 1 as the minimum number of observations in the window that are required to have a value, and False, so that the labels are not set at the center of the window. Next, don‚Äôt forget to also chain the mean() function so that you calculate the rolling mean. After you have calculated the mean average of the short and long windows, you should create a signal when the short moving average crosses the long moving average, but only for the period greater than the shortest moving average window. In Python, this will result in a condition: signals['short_mavg'][short_window:] > signals['long_mavg'][short_window:]. Note that you add the [short_window:] to comply with the condition ‚Äúonly for the period greater than the shortest moving average window‚Äù. When the condition is true, the initialized value 0.0 in the signal column will be overwritten with 1.0. A ‚Äúsignal‚Äù is created! If the condition is false, the original value of 0.0 will be kept and no signal is generated. You use the NumPy where() function to set up this condition. Much the same like you read just now, the variable to which you assign this result is signals['signal'][short_window], because you only want to create signals for the period greater than the shortest moving average window! Lastly, you take the difference of the signals in order to generate actual trading orders. In other words, in this column of your signals DataFrame, you‚Äôll be able to distinguish between long and short positions, whether you‚Äôre buying or selling stock.",2021-05-06T22:27:11Z,en

253930210,CalebEmelike/3rd-Position-solution_for_the__African-COVID-19__zindi_hackathon,"Can we infer important COVID-19 public health risk factors from outdated data? In many countries census and other survey data may be incomplete or out of date. This challenge is to develop a proof-of-concept for how machine learning can help governments more accurately map COVID-19 risk in 2020 using old data, without requiring a new costly, risky, and time-consuming on-the-ground survey.  The 2011 census gives us valuable information for determining who might be most vulnerable to COVID-19 in South Africa. However, the data is nearly 10 years old, and we expect that some key indicators will have changed in that time. Building an up-to-date map showing where the most vulnerable are located will be a key step in responding to the disease. A mapping effort like this requires bringing together many different inputs and tools. For this competition, we‚Äôre starting small. Can we infer important risk factors from more readily available data?  The task is to predict the percentage of households that fall into a particularly vulnerable bracket - large households who must leave their homes to fetch water - using 2011 South African census data. Solving this challenge will show that with machine learning it is possible to use easy-to-measure stats to identify areas most at risk even in years when census data is not collected.",2020-05-10T05:31:41Z,en

260446892,abebual/Predicting-ICU-Patient-Clinical-Deterioration---Report,"For this project, I used publicly available Electronic Health Records (EHRs) datasets. The MIT Media Lab for Computational Physiology has developed MIMIC-IIIv1.4 dataset based on 46,520 patients who stayed in critical care units of the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center of Boston between 2001 and 2012. MIMIC-IIIv1.4 dataset is freely available to researchers across the world. A formal request should be made directly to www.mimic.physionet.org, to gain access to the data. There is a required course on human research ‚ÄòData or Specimens Only Research‚Äô prior to data access request. I have secured one here -www.citiprogram.org/verify/?kb6607b78-5821-4de5-8cad-daf929f7fbbf-33486907.  We built flexible and better performing model using the same 17 variables used in the SAPS II severity prediction model. The question ‚ÄòCan we improve the prediction performance of widely used severity scores using a more flexible model?‚Äô is the central question of our project.  I used the exact 17 variables used to develop the SAPS II severity prediction algorithm. These are 13 physiological variables, three underlying (chronic) disease variables and one admission variable.  The physiological variables includes demographic (age), vital (Glasgow Comma Scale, systolic blood pressure, Oxygenation, Renal, White blood cells count, serum bicarbonate level, blood sodium level, blood potassium level, and blood bilirubin level). The three underlying disease variables includes Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS), metastatic cancer, and hematologic malignancy. Finally, whether admission was scheduled surgical or unscheduled surgical was included in the model.  The dataset has 26 relational tables including patient‚Äôs hospital admission, callout information when patient was ready for discharge, caregiver information, electronic charted events including vital signs and any additional information relevant to patient care, patient demographic data, list of services the patient was admitted or transferred under, ICU stay types, diagnoses types, laboratory measurments, microbiology tests and sensitivity, prescription data and billing information.  Although I have full access to the MIMIC-IIIv1.4 datasets, I can not share any part of the data publicly. If you are interested to learn more about the data, there is a MIMIC III Demo dataset based on 100 patients https://mimic.physionet.org/gettingstarted/demo/.

Traditionally, phishing website detection is done through the usage of blacklist databases. However, due to the current, rapid development of global networking and communication technologies, there are numerous websites and it has become difficult to classify based on traditional methods since new websites are created every second. In this paper, we are proposing a real-time, anti-phishing system. In the first step, we extract the lexical and host-based properties of a website. In the second step, we combine URL (Uniform Resource Locator) features, NLP and host-based properties to train the machine learning and deep learning models. Our detection model is able to detect phishing URLs with a detection rate of 94.89%.",2021-04-26T15:41:01Z,en

Low-income countries have an estimated treatment gap of 85% (as compared with high-income countries with a gap of 35% to 50%). While Kenya has a mental illness prevalence rate that is comparable to that of high-income countries, there are still less than 500 healthcare professionals serving the country.  In Kenya, there are growing concerns about mental health among young people, particularly university students that face a challenging and unique conflation of stressors that put them at risk of challenges like depression and substance abuse.  From the use of app-based solutions for screening to electronically delivered therapies, the use of technologies including machine learning and AI will potentially transform the delivery of mental health services in the coming years.  The objective of this challenge is to develop a machine learning model that classifies statements and questions expressed by university students in Kenya when speaking about the mental health challenges they struggle with. The four categories are depression, suicide, alchoholism, and drug abuse.  This solution will be used for a prototype of a mental health chatbot designed specifically for university students. This initiative is a first step in leveraging technology to make mental health services more accessible and more user-friendly for young people in Kenya and around the world",2021-03-08T18:23:33Z,en

News in Swahili is an important part of the media sphere in Tanzania.  News contributes to education, technology, and economic growth of a country, and news in local languages plays an important cultural role in many Africa countries. In the modern age, African languages in news and other spheres are at risk of being lost as English becomes the dominant language in online spaces.  The objective of this hackathon is to develop a multi-class classification model to classify news content according to their specific categories specified.The model can be used by Swahili online news platforms to automatically group news according to their categories and help readers find the specific news they want to read.

278027073,AgHarsh/Fault-Detection-in-Power-Microgrid,"This project presents the concept of fault detection and location in a Power Microgrid making use of the machine learning concepts like Artificial Neural Network. The electronic equipment used in microgrids is in essential need of more secure protection against short circuit faults. Due to the high current at the time of fault occurrence, the whole system might be de-energized which would have a severely negative impact on the entire system. A fault occurs when two or more conductors come in contact with each other or ground. Ground faults are considered as one of the main problems in power systems and account for more than 80% of all faults. An effective method to detect, isolate, and protect the power microgrid system against the effects of short circuit faults is extremely important. In this project we worked on a highly effective new method to protect the microgrid system using an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) that will detect and find the location of the fault before it affects other parts of the system. It would, therefore, be more dependable for microgrid protection. This protection network is distributed all along the power microgrid system protecting the entire microgrid network and is connected to the other protective devices in the system. This project focuses on detecting faults and identifying the location of the faults on electric power transmission lines in the power microgrid network.",2021-05-08T00:40:05Z,en

If we were to answer the question that why we need a deep learning model for early detection of COVID-19 from chest x-ray images, we can say the followings, doctors have seen that even if the test kits desined for diagnosis results in negative, the real results are positive for some patients when they review the chest X-ray images. For now the public dataset contains less amount of data which you can see in the dataset2 folder. We get this dataset from open-source https://github.com/ieee8023/covid-chestxray-dataset, but for sure it is not enough to train a proper deep learning model. But just to show that how easy it is to create an AI for the early detection of these kind of viruses. Just keep in mind that this cannot be used for diagnosis without training many more images in high-resolution and professinal medical tests. There you go! Let's work together to fight against COVID-19. As a tool, I used Keras with Tensorflow background, and the model can be improved by addig more convolution and pooling layers, and increasing the number of feature detectors'.

This project is based on analysing the English tweets and categorizing the tweets based on the sentiment and emotions of the user. The literature survey conducted showed promising results of using hybrid methodologies for sentiment and emotion analysis. Four different hybrid methodologies have been used for analysing the tweets belonging to various categories. A combination of classification and regression approaches using different deep learning models such as Bidirectional LSTM, LSTM and Convolutional neural network (CNN) are implemented to perform sentiment and behaviour analysis of the tweets. A novel approach of combining Vader and NRC lexicon is used to generate the sentiment and emotion polarity and categories. The evaluation metrics such as accuracy, mean absolute error and mean square error are used to test the performance of the model.  The business use cases for the models applied here can be to understand the opinion of customers towards their business to improve their service. Contradictory to the suggestions of Google‚Äôs S/W ratio method, LSTM models performed better than using CNN models for categorical as well as regression problems.",2021-05-12T19:30:48Z,en

One of the problem your client is facing is around identifying the right people for promotion (only for manager position and below) and prepare them in time. Currently the process, they are following is:  They first identify a set of employees based on recommendations/ past performance Selected employees go through the separate training and evaluation program for each vertical. These programs are based on the required skill of each vertical At the end of the program, based on various factors such as training performance, KPI completion (only employees with KPIs completed greater than 60% are considered) etc., employee gets promotion For above mentioned process, the final promotions are only announced after the evaluation and this leads to delay in transition to their new roles. Hence, company needs your help in identifying the eligible candidates at a particular checkpoint so that they can expedite the entire promotion cycle.   They have provided multiple attributes around Employee's past and current performance along with demographics. Now, The task is to predict whether a potential promotee at checkpoint in the test set will be promoted or not after the evaluation process.",2021-05-04T14:23:15Z,en

Due to the lack of reliable test and validation datasets, anomaly-based intrusion detection approaches are suffering from consistent and accurate performance evolutions.  Our evaluations of the existing eleven datasets since 1998 show that most are out of date and unreliable. Some of these datasets suffer from the lack of traffic diversity and volumes, some do not cover the variety of known attacks, while others anonymize packet payload data, which cannot reflect the current trends. Some are also lacking feature set and metadata.  CICIDS2017 dataset contains benign and the most up-to-date common attacks, which resembles the true real-world data (PCAPs). It also includes the results of the network traffic analysis using CICFlowMeter with labeled flows based on the time stamp, source, and destination IPs, source and destination ports, protocols and attack (CSV files). Also available is the extracted features definition.  Generating realistic background traffic was our top priority in building this dataset. We have used our proposed B-Profile system (Sharafaldin, et al. 2016) to profile the abstract behavior of human interactions and generates naturalistic benign background traffic. For this dataset, we built the abstract behaviour of 25 users based on the HTTP, HTTPS, FTP, SSH, and email protocols.  The data capturing period started at 9 a.m., Monday, July 3, 2017 and ended at 5 p.m. on Friday July 7, 2017, for a total of 5 days. Monday is the normal day and only includes the benign traffic. The implemented attacks include Brute Force FTP, Brute Force SSH, DoS, Heartbleed, Web Attack, Infiltration, Botnet and DDoS. They have been executed both morning and afternoon on Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday and Friday.",2021-05-27T03:45:17Z,en

294592756,UNHSAILLab/SentimentalLIAR,"Our Sentimental LIAR dataset is a modified and further extended version of the LIAR extension introduced by Kirilin et al. In our dataset, the multi-class labeling of LIAR is converted to a binary annotation by changing half-true, false, barely-true and pants-fire labels to False, and the remaining labels to True. Furthermore, we convert the speaker names to numerical IDs in order to avoid bias with regards to the textual representation of names. The binary-label dataset is then extended by adding sentiments derived using the Google NLP API . Sentiment analysis determines the overall attitude of the text (i.e., whether it is positive or negative), and is quantified by a numerical score. If the sentiment score is positive, then we assign Positive for the sentiment attribute, otherwise Negative is assigned. We also introduced a further extension by adding emotion scores extracted using the IBM NLP API for each claim, which determine the detected level of 6 emotional states namely anger, sadness, disgust, fear and joy. The score for each emotion is between the range of 0 and 1. Table I demonstrates a sample record in Sentimental LIAR for a short claim in the LIAR dataset  This repository contains the dataset for this paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.01047",2021-05-09T16:20:05Z,en

My team and I focused on the image only due to many noise in the title dataset (i.e. we've found that there are similar titles for different images). To employ image processing, we propose the use of pretrained model, VGG16, and the SIFT (Scale-Invariant Feature Transform). On one hand, the VGG16 is performed to extract the value of similarity between two images. On the other hand, the SIFT score is used to detect number of edges and ratio score between two images.",2021-02-19T18:15:20Z,en

In our neural network architecture, we embed a dynamically programmable quantum circuit, acting as a hidden layer, to learn the correct parameters to correctly classify handwritten digits from the MNIST database. By starting small and making incremental improvements, we successfully reach a stunning ~95% accuracy on identifying previously unseen digits from 0 to 7 using this architecture!",2021-04-26T08:57:02Z,en

It is one of the techniques of encryption and over the years, steganography has been used to encode a lower resolution image into a higher resolution image. But steganography using naive methods, like LSB manipulation, is susceptible to statistical analysis. Our model extends existing deep learning research for encoding multiple secret images onto a single cover by leveraging convolutional neural networks based deep learning architectures. DeepSteg allows senders to embed up to three secret images onto a single cover using an encoder network and then have multiple decoder networks to obtain the embedded secrets.",2021-05-25T09:58:12Z,en

316750618,alexcaselli/Federated-Learning-for-Human-Mobility-Models,"Thanks to the proliferation of smart devices, such as smartphones and wearables, which are equipped with computation, communication and sensing capabilities, a plethora of new location-based services and applications are available for the users at any time and everywhere. Understanding human mobility has gain importance to offer better services able to provide valuable products to the user whenever it's required. The ability to predict when and where individuals will go next allows enabling smart recommendation systems or a better organization of resources such as public transport vehicles or taxis. Network providers can predict future activities of individuals and groups to optimize network handovers, while transport systems can provide more vehicles or lines where required, reducing waiting time and discomfort to their clients.   The representation of the movements of individuals or groups of mobile entities are called human mobility models. Such models replicate real human mobility characteristics, enabling to simulate movements of different individuals and infer their future whereabouts.  The development of these models requires to collect in a centralized location, as a server, the information related to the users' locations.  Such data represents sensitive information, and the collection of those threatens the privacy of the users involved. The recent introduction of federated learning, a privacy-preserving approach to build machine and deep learning models, represents a promising technique to solve the privacy issue. Federated learning allows mobile devices to contribute with their private data to the model creation without sharing them with a centralized server. In this thesis, we investigate the application of the federated learning paradigm to the field of human mobility modelling.  Using three different mobility datasets, we first designed and developed a robust human mobility model by investigating different classes of neural networks and the influence of demographic data over models' performance. Second, we applied federated learning to create a human mobility model based on deep learning which does not require the collection of users' mobility traces, achieving promising results on two different datasets. Users' data remains so distributed over the big number of devices which have generated them, while the model is shared and trained among the server and the devices.  Furthermore, the developed federated model has been the subject of different analyses including: the effects of sparse availability of the clients; The communication costs required by federated settings; The application of transfer-learning techniques and model refinement through federated learning and, lastly, the influence of differential privacy on the model‚Äôs prediction performance, also called utility",2021-05-06T09:58:57Z,en

Since the original script of myalexnet_forward written by the AlexNet team was build on TensorFlow 1.x in 2017, it has generated many errors during the runtime in the env. of TensorFlow 2.x. Either the AlexNet team has no time to update, or it is very hard for developers to find out the AlexNet variants to adapt to TensorFlow 2.0/2.1/2.2 with the Google search. Furthermore, I split the AlexNet model in both the OOP and the pure command style and make client applications to call the AlexNet model because the AlexNet model is not separated in most of the published scenarios which incur the difficulties for developer's deep learning. Considering that AlexNet is the greatest milestone in the CNNN/DNN history (Mr. Hinton has just won the Turing Award in 2019 and the event is not far from fading away), it is important to continue its usability and accessibility to all developers. It is exciting for me to take the opportunity to share the new update.",2021-06-08T11:47:32Z,en

263323951,arpit0891/Plant-Disease-Detection-Web-application,"Deep learning with convolutional neural networks (CNNs) has achieved great success in the classification of various plant diseases. However, a limited number of studies have elucidated the process of inference, leaving it as an untouchable black box. Revealing the CNN to extract the learned feature as an interpretable form not only ensures its reliability but also enables the validation of the model authenticity and the training dataset by human intervention. In this study, a variety of neuron-wise and layer-wise visualization methods were applied using a CNN, trained with a publicly available plant disease image dataset. We showed that neural networks can capture the colors and textures of lesions specific to respective diseases upon diagnosis, which resembles human decision-making. While several visualization methods were used as they are, others had to be optimized to target a specific layer that fully captures the features to generate consequential outputs. Moreover, by interpreting the generated attention maps, we identified several layers that were not contributing to inference and removed such layers inside the network, decreasing the number of parameters by 75% without affecting the classification accuracy. The results provide an impetus for the CNN black box users in the field of plant science to better understand the diagnosis process and lead to further efficient use of deep learning for plant disease diagnosis.",2021-06-03T19:40:38Z,en
