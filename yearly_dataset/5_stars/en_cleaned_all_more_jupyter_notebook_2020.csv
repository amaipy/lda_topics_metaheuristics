231845283,fabriziobasso/PCAapplied_and_European_Yield_Curve,"This paper aims to explore the time series‚Äô proprieties of the features extracted by using the Principal Component Analysis (PCA) technique on the European AAA-rated Government Bond Yield curve. The PCA can greatly simplify the problem of modelling the yield curve by massively reducing its dimensionality to a small set of uncorrelated features. It Ô¨Ånds several applications in Ô¨Ånance and in the Ô¨Åxed income particularly from risk management to trade recommendation. After selecting a subset of Principal Components (PCs), this paper Ô¨Årst analyzes their nature in comparison to the original rates and the implications in terms of information retained and lost. Then the time-series characteristics of each PC are studied and, when possible, Auto-Regressive Moving-Average (ARMA) models will be Ô¨Åtted on the data. One hundred observations of the original dataset are set aside as a test set to evaluate the predictive power of these models. Eventually, further analyses are performed on the PCs to evaluate the presence of heteroscedasticity and GARCH-ARCH models are Ô¨Åtted when possible. Tests are performed on the Ô¨Åtted coeÔ¨Écient to investigate the real nature of the conditional variance process.",2021-05-27T06:00:45Z,paper aim explore time_series propriety feature extract principal component analysis pca technique european aaa rate government bond yield curve pca greatly simplify problem model yield curve massively reduce dimensionality set uncorrelated feature nds nance xed income risk management trade recommendation select subset principal component pc paper rst analyze nature comparison original rate implication term information retain lose time_series characteristic pc studied auto regressive average arma model tte data observation original dataset set set evaluate predictive power model eventually analysis perform pcs evaluate presence heteroscedasticity garch arch model tte perform tte coe cient investigate real nature conditional variance process,nature tte

236035069,SuryaSrikar/Phishing_Attack_Detection_With_NaturalLanguageProcessing,"Phishing websites are fraudulent sites that impersonate a trusted party to gain access to sensitive information of an individual person or organization. Traditionally, phishing website detection is done through the usage of blacklist databases. However, due to the current, rapid development of global networking and communication technologies, there are numerous websites and it has become difficult to classify based on traditional methods since new websites are created every second. In this paper, we are proposing a real-time, anti-phishing system. In the first step, we extract the lexical and host-based properties of a website. In the second step, we combine URL (Uniform Resource Locator) features, NLP and host-based properties to train the machine learning and deep learning models. Our detection model is able to detect phishing URLs with a detection rate of 94.89%.",2021-04-26T15:41:01Z,phishe website fraudulent site impersonate trust party gain access sensitive information individual person organization traditionally phishe website detection usage blacklist database current rapid development global networking communication technology numerous website difficult classify traditional method website create paper propose real_time anti phishing step extract lexical host property website step combine url uniform resource locator feature nlp host property train machine_learning deep_learning model detection model detect phishe url detection rate,website phishe property url

The purpose of this project is to create dynamic statistical models of intraday trading volume prediction (in Python). By assuming the stable U shape distribution of intraday trading volume, we apply Deterministic blend, Lognormal Bayesian, Kalman filter and ARIMA model to estimate and generate out of sample forecast on 12 US equity sector ETFs. Results show that some of the proposed methods are able to obviously outperform common volume forecasting methods.",2021-06-16T10:03:24Z,effective intraday forecast level trading volume vital algorithmic_trading portfolio management attempt minimize transaction cost optimally scheduling placing create dynamic statistical model intraday trading volume prediction assume stable shape distribution intraday trading volume apply deterministic blend lognormal bayesian kalman filter arima model estimate generate forecast equity sector etfs propose method outperform common volume forecasting method,volume trading intraday

278027073,AgHarsh/Fault-Detection-in-Power-Microgrid,"This project presents the concept of fault detection and location in a Power Microgrid making use of the machine learning concepts like Artificial Neural Network. The electronic equipment used in microgrids is in essential need of more secure protection against short circuit faults. Due to the high current at the time of fault occurrence, the whole system might be de-energized which would have a severely negative impact on the entire system. A fault occurs when two or more conductors come in contact with each other or ground. Ground faults are considered as one of the main problems in power systems and account for more than 80% of all faults. An effective method to detect, isolate, and protect the power microgrid system against the effects of short circuit faults is extremely important. In this project we worked on a highly effective new method to protect the microgrid system using an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) that will detect and find the location of the fault before it affects other parts of the system. It would, therefore, be more dependable for microgrid protection. This protection network is distributed all along the power microgrid system protecting the entire microgrid network and is connected to the other protective devices in the system. This project focuses on detecting faults and identifying the location of the faults on electric power transmission lines in the power microgrid network.",2021-05-08T00:40:05Z,concept fault detection location power microgrid machine_learning concept artificial neural_network electronic equipment microgrid essential secure protection short circuit fault current time fault occurrence energize severely negative impact entire fault occur conductor contact ground ground fault main problem power account fault effective method detect isolate protect power microgrid short circuit fault extremely highly effective method protect microgrid artificial neural_network ann detect location fault dependable microgrid protection protection network distribute power microgrid protect entire microgrid network connect protective device focus detect fault identify location fault electric power transmission power microgrid network,power fault microgrid protection

If we were to answer the question that why we need a deep learning model for early detection of COVID-19 from chest x-ray images, we can say the followings, doctors have seen that even if the test kits desined for diagnosis results in negative, the real results are positive for some patients when they review the chest X-ray images. For now the public dataset contains less amount of data which you can see in the dataset2 folder. We get this dataset from open-source https://github.com/ieee8023/covid-chestxray-dataset, but for sure it is not enough to train a proper deep learning model. But just to show that how easy it is to create an AI for the early detection of these kind of viruses. Just keep in mind that this cannot be used for diagnosis without training many more images in high-resolution and professinal medical tests. There you go! Let's work together to fight against COVID-19. As a tool, I used Keras with Tensorflow background, and the model can be improved by addig more convolution and pooling layers, and increasing the number of feature detectors'.

This project is based on analysing the English tweets and categorizing the tweets based on the sentiment and emotions of the user. The literature survey conducted showed promising results of using hybrid methodologies for sentiment and emotion analysis. Four different hybrid methodologies have been used for analysing the tweets belonging to various categories. A combination of classification and regression approaches using different deep learning models such as Bidirectional LSTM, LSTM and Convolutional neural network (CNN) are implemented to perform sentiment and behaviour analysis of the tweets. A novel approach of combining Vader and NRC lexicon is used to generate the sentiment and emotion polarity and categories. The evaluation metrics such as accuracy, mean absolute error and mean square error are used to test the performance of the model.  The business use cases for the models applied here can be to understand the opinion of customers towards their business to improve their service. Contradictory to the suggestions of Google‚Äôs S/W ratio method, LSTM models performed better than using CNN models for categorical as well as regression problems.",2021-05-12T19:30:48Z,twitter tweet play role organisation analyse english tweet categorize tweet sentiment emotion user literature survey conduct promise hybrid methodology sentiment emotion analysis hybrid methodology analyse tweet belong category combination classification regression deep_learning model bidirectional lstm lstm convolutional_neural network cnn perform sentiment behaviour analysis tweet combine vader nrc lexicon generate sentiment emotion polarity category evaluation metric accuracy absolute error square error performance model business model apply opinion customer business service contradictory suggestion google ratio method lstm model perform cnn model categorical regression problem,emotion tweet sentiment

One of the problem your client is facing is around identifying the right people for promotion (only for manager position and below) and prepare them in time. Currently the process, they are following is:  They first identify a set of employees based on recommendations/ past performance Selected employees go through the separate training and evaluation program for each vertical. These programs are based on the required skill of each vertical At the end of the program, based on various factors such as training performance, KPI completion (only employees with KPIs completed greater than 60% are considered) etc., employee gets promotion For above mentioned process, the final promotions are only announced after the evaluation and this leads to delay in transition to their new roles. Hence, company needs your help in identifying the eligible candidates at a particular checkpoint so that they can expedite the entire promotion cycle.   They have provided multiple attributes around Employee's past and current performance along with demographics. Now, The task is to predict whether a potential promotee at checkpoint in the test set will be promoted or not after the evaluation process.",2021-05-04T14:23:15Z,client mnc broad vertical organisation problem client facing identify people promotion manager position prepare time process identify set employee recommendations performance select employee separate training evaluation vertical require skill vertical end factor training performance kpi completion employee kpis employee promotion mention process promotion evaluation lead delay transition role company identify eligible candidate checkpoint expedite entire promotion cycle multiple attribute employee current performance demographic task predict potential promotee checkpoint set promote evaluation process,employee promotion evaluation checkpoint vertical

304518431,abhishekpatel-lpu/CICIDS-2017-intrution-detection-,"Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) and Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPSs) are the most important defense tools against the sophisticated and ever-growing network attacks. Due to the lack of reliable test and validation datasets, anomaly-based intrusion detection approaches are suffering from consistent and accurate performance evolutions.  Our evaluations of the existing eleven datasets since 1998 show that most are out of date and unreliable. Some of these datasets suffer from the lack of traffic diversity and volumes, some do not cover the variety of known attacks, while others anonymize packet payload data, which cannot reflect the current trends. Some are also lacking feature set and metadata.  CICIDS2017 dataset contains benign and the most up-to-date common attacks, which resembles the true real-world data (PCAPs). It also includes the results of the network traffic analysis using CICFlowMeter with labeled flows based on the time stamp, source, and destination IPs, source and destination ports, protocols and attack (CSV files). Also available is the extracted features definition.  Generating realistic background traffic was our top priority in building this dataset. We have used our proposed B-Profile system (Sharafaldin, et al. 2016) to profile the abstract behavior of human interactions and generates naturalistic benign background traffic. For this dataset, we built the abstract behaviour of 25 users based on the HTTP, HTTPS, FTP, SSH, and email protocols.  The data capturing period started at 9 a.m., Monday, July 3, 2017 and ended at 5 p.m. on Friday July 7, 2017, for a total of 5 days. Monday is the normal day and only includes the benign traffic. The implemented attacks include Brute Force FTP, Brute Force SSH, DoS, Heartbleed, Web Attack, Infiltration, Botnet and DDoS. They have been executed both morning and afternoon on Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday and Friday.",2021-05-27T03:45:17Z,intrusion detection idss intrusion prevention ipss defense tool sophisticated grow network attack lack reliable validation dataset anomaly intrusion detection suffer consistent accurate performance evolution evaluation exist dataset date unreliable dataset suffer lack traffic diversity volume cover variety attack anonymize packet payload data reflect current trend lack feature set metadata cicids2017 dataset benign date common attack resemble true real data pcap network traffic analysis cicflowmeter label flow time stamp destination ips destination port protocol attack csv file extract feature definition generate realistic background traffic priority building dataset propose profile sharafaldin profile abstract behavior human interaction generate naturalistic benign background traffic dataset build abstract behaviour user http https ftp ssh email protocol data capturing period monday july friday july total day monday normal day benign traffic attack brute force ftp brute force ssh heartbleed web attack infiltration botnet ddo execute morning afternoon tuesday wednesday thursday friday,attack traffic benign lack

How about using images for this exchange? Steganography is what you need! It is one of the techniques of encryption and over the years, steganography has been used to encode a lower resolution image into a higher resolution image. But steganography using naive methods, like LSB manipulation, is susceptible to statistical analysis. Our model extends existing deep learning research for encoding multiple secret images onto a single cover by leveraging convolutional neural networks based deep learning architectures. DeepSteg allows senders to embed up to three secret images onto a single cover using an encoder network and then have multiple decoder networks to obtain the embedded secrets.",2021-05-25T09:58:12Z,hide message invisible ink friend intrigue idea cryptic message exchange image exchange steganography technique encryption steganography encode resolution image resolution image steganography naive method lsb manipulation susceptible statistical analysis model extend exist deep_learning research encode multiple secret image single cover leverage convolutional_neural network deep_learning architecture deepsteg sender embe secret image single cover encoder network multiple decoder network embed secret,image exchange message secret steganography

In our model, we try to imbibe this approach by fusing the 3 modalities i.e. word context, audio, and video and predict an output regarding the mental health of the patient. The output is divided into a binary yes/no denoting whether the patient has symptoms of depression. We‚Äôve built a deep learning model that fuses these 3 modalities, assigning them appropriate weights, and thus gives an output.",2021-05-26T05:51:10Z,conventionally depression detection extensive clinical interview subject sponse study psychologist determine mental state model imbibe fuse modality word context audio video predict output mental health patient output divide binary denote patient symptom depression build deep_learning model fuse modality assign weight output,output patient depression fuse mental modality

Since the original script of myalexnet_forward written by the AlexNet team was build on TensorFlow 1.x in 2017, it has generated many errors during the runtime in the env. of TensorFlow 2.x. Either the AlexNet team has no time to update, or it is very hard for developers to find out the AlexNet variants to adapt to TensorFlow 2.0/2.1/2.2 with the Google search. Furthermore, I split the AlexNet model in both the OOP and the pure command style and make client applications to call the AlexNet model because the AlexNet model is not separated in most of the published scenarios which incur the difficulties for developer's deep learning. Considering that AlexNet is the greatest milestone in the CNNN/DNN history (Mr. Hinton has just won the Turing Award in 2019 and the event is not far from fading away), it is important to continue its usability and accessibility to all developers. It is exciting for me to take the opportunity to share the new update.",2021-06-08T11:47:32Z,update alexnet variant adapt tensorflow_2 original myalexnet alexnet team build tensorflow generate error runtime env tensorflow_2 alexnet team time update hard developer alexnet variant adapt tensorflow_2 google search split alexnet model oop pure command style client call alexnet model alexnet model separate publish scenario incur difficulty developer deep_learning alexnet milestone cnnn dnn history hinton turing award event fade continue usability accessibility developer exciting opportunity share update,developer update alexnet

263323951,arpit0891/Plant-Disease-Detection-Web-application,"Deep learning with convolutional neural networks (CNNs) has achieved great success in the classification of various plant diseases. However, a limited number of studies have elucidated the process of inference, leaving it as an untouchable black box. Revealing the CNN to extract the learned feature as an interpretable form not only ensures its reliability but also enables the validation of the model authenticity and the training dataset by human intervention. In this study, a variety of neuron-wise and layer-wise visualization methods were applied using a CNN, trained with a publicly available plant disease image dataset. We showed that neural networks can capture the colors and textures of lesions specific to respective diseases upon diagnosis, which resembles human decision-making. While several visualization methods were used as they are, others had to be optimized to target a specific layer that fully captures the features to generate consequential outputs. Moreover, by interpreting the generated attention maps, we identified several layers that were not contributing to inference and removed such layers inside the network, decreasing the number of parameters by 75% without affecting the classification accuracy. The results provide an impetus for the CNN black box users in the field of plant science to better understand the diagnosis process and lead to further efficient use of deep learning for plant disease diagnosis.",2021-06-03T19:40:38Z,deep_learning convolutional_neural network cnns achieve success classification plant_disease limited study elucidated process inference leave untouchable black box reveal cnn extract learn feature interpretable form ensure reliability enable validation model authenticity training dataset human intervention study a_variety neuron wise layer wise visualization method apply cnn train publicly plant_disease image dataset neural_network capture color texture lesion specific respective disease diagnosis resemble human decision visualization method optimize target specific layer capture feature generate consequential output interpret generate attention map identify layer contribute inference remove layer network decrease parameter classification accuracy impetus cnn black box user field plant science diagnosis process lead efficient deep_learning plant_disease diagnosis,layer diagnosis plant_disease
