167422421,mudigosa/Image-Classifier,"Image Classifier  Going forward, AI algorithms will be incorporated into more and more everyday applications. For example, you might want to include an image classifier in a smartphone app. To do this, you'd use a deep learning model trained on hundreds of thousands of images as part of the overall application architecture. A large part of software development in the future will be using these types of models as common parts of applications.  In this project, you'll train an image classifier to recognize different species of flowers. You can imagine using something like this in a phone app that tells you the name of the flower your camera is looking at. In practice, you'd train this classifier, then export it for use in your application. We'll be using this dataset of 102 flower categories.  When you've completed this project, you'll have an application that can be trained on any set of labelled images. Here your network will be learning about flowers and end up as a command line application. But, what you do with your new skills depends on your imagination and effort in building a dataset.  This is the final Project of the Udacity AI with Python Nanodegree Prerequisites  The Code is written in Python 3.6.5 . If you don't have Python installed you can find it here. If you are using a lower version of Python you can upgrade using the pip package, ensuring you have the latest version of pip.  To install pip run in the command Line  python -m ensurepip -- default-pip  to upgrade it  python -m pip install -- upgrade pip setuptools wheel  to upgrade Python  pip install python -- upgrade  Additional Packages that are required are: Numpy, Pandas, MatplotLib, Pytorch, PIL and json. You can donwload them using pip  pip install numpy pandas matplotlib pil  or conda  conda install numpy pandas matplotlib pil  In order to intall Pytorch head over to the Pytorch site select your specs and follow the instructions given. Viewing the Jyputer Notebook  In order to better view and work on the jupyter Notebook I encourage you to use nbviewer . You can simply copy and paste the link to this website and you will be able to edit it without any problem. Alternatively you can clone the repository using  git clone https://github.com/fotisk07/Image-Classifier/  then in the command Line type, after you have downloaded jupyter notebook type  jupyter notebook  locate the notebook and run it. Command Line Application      Train a new network on a data set with train.py         Basic Usage : python train.py data_directory         Prints out current epoch, training loss, validation loss, and validation accuracy as the netowrk trains         Options:             Set direcotry to save checkpoints: python train.py data_dor --save_dir save_directory             Choose arcitecture (alexnet, densenet121 or vgg16 available): pytnon train.py data_dir --arch ""vgg16""             Set hyperparameters: python train.py data_dir --learning_rate 0.001 --hidden_layer1 120 --epochs 20             Use GPU for training: python train.py data_dir --gpu gpu      Predict flower name from an image with predict.py along with the probability of that name. That is you'll pass in a single image /path/to/image and return the flower name and class probability         Basic usage: python predict.py /path/to/image checkpoint         Options:             Return top K most likely classes: python predict.py input checkpoint ---top_k 3             Use a mapping of categories to real names: python predict.py input checkpoint --category_names cat_To_name.json             Use GPU for inference: python predict.py input checkpoint --gpu  Json file  In order for the network to print out the name of the flower a .json file is required. If you aren't familiar with json you can find information here. By using a .json file the data can be sorted into folders with numbers and those numbers will correspond to specific names specified in the .json file. Data and the json file  The data used specifically for this assignemnt are a flower database are not provided in the repository as it's larger than what github allows. Nevertheless, feel free to create your own databases and train the model on them to use with your own projects. The structure of your data should be the following: The data need to comprised of 3 folders, test, train and validate. Generally the proportions should be 70% training 10% validate and 20% test. Inside the train, test and validate folders there should be folders bearing a specific number which corresponds to a specific category, clarified in the json file. For example if we have the image a.jpj and it is a rose it could be in a path like this /test/5/a.jpg and json file would be like this {...5:""rose"",...}. Make sure to include a lot of photos of your catagories (more than 10) with different angles and different lighting conditions in order for the network to generalize better. GPU  As the network makes use of a sophisticated deep convolutional neural network the training process is impossible to be done by a common laptop. In order to train your models to your local machine you have three options      Cuda -- If you have an NVIDIA GPU then you can install CUDA from here. With Cuda you will be able to train your model however the process will still be time consuming     Cloud Services -- There are many paid cloud services that let you train your models like AWS or Google Cloud     Coogle Colab -- Google Colab gives you free access to a tesla K80 GPU for 12 hours at a time. Once 12 hours have ellapsed you can just reload and continue! The only limitation is that you have to upload the data to Google Drive and if the dataset is massive you may run out of space.  However, once a model is trained then a normal CPU can be used for the predict.py file and you will have an answer within some seconds. Hyperparameters  As you can see you have a wide selection of hyperparameters available and you can get even more by making small modifications to the code. Thus it may seem overly complicated to choose the right ones especially if the training needs at least 15 minutes to be completed. So here are some hints:      By increasing the number of epochs the accuracy of the network on the training set gets better and better however be careful because if you pick a large number of epochs the network won't generalize well, that is to say it will have high accuracy on the training image and low accuracy on the test images. Eg: training for 12 epochs training accuracy: 85% Test accuracy: 82%. Training for 30 epochs training accuracy 95% test accuracy 50%.     A big learning rate guarantees that the network will converge fast to a small error but it will constantly overshot     A small learning rate guarantees that the network will reach greater accuracies but the learning process will take longer     Densenet121 works best for images but the training process takes significantly longer than alexnet or vgg16  *My settings were lr=0.001, dropoup=0.5, epochs= 15 and my test accuracy was 86% with densenet121 as my feature extraction model. Pre-Trained Network  The checkpoint.pth file contains the information of a network trained to recognise 102 different species of flowers. I has been trained with specific hyperparameters thus if you don't set them right the network will fail. In order to have a prediction for an image located in the path /path/to/image using my pretrained model you can simply type python predict.py /path/to/image checkpoint.pth Contributing  Please read CONTRIBUTING.md for the process for submitting pull requests.

174942404,LeadingIndiaAI/Wake-UP-word-detection,"Wake-up-word(WUW)system is an emerging development in recent times. Voice interaction with systems have made life ease and aids in multi-tasking. Apple, Google, Microsoft, Amazon have developed a custom wake-word engine, which are addressed by words such as ‚ÄòHey Siri‚Äô. ‚ÄòOk Google‚Äô, ‚ÄòCortana‚Äô, ‚ÄòAlexa‚Äô. Our project focuses initially only detection and response to a customized wake-up command. The wake-up command used is ‚ÄúGOLUMOLU‚Äù. A wake-up-word detection system search for specific word and reads the word, where it rejects all other words, phrases and sounds. WUW system needs only less memory space, low computational cost and high precision. Artificial Neural Networks(ANN) have reduced the complexity, computational time, latency, thus the efficiency of system has improved. Deep learning has improved the efficiency of automatic speech recognition(SR), where wake word detection is a subset of SR but unlike keyword spotting and voice recognition. A deep learning RNN model is used for the training of the network. RNN are specifically used in case of temporal sequence data and has the ability to process data of different length but of same dimension. For training a model, labelled dataset is needed. We generated three forms of data: golumolu, negative and background. Such that, the model learns circumspectly and attentively detects when specific word found. To start communication with system, the wake word should be delivered. The main task of WUW detection system is to detect the speech, to identify WUW words among spoken words, to check whether the word spoken in altering context.",2020-07-17T06:31:48Z,en

180205524,SudiptaSingh/Q-Learning-based-smart-cab,"Problem Statement  A smart city needs smart mobility, and to achieve this objective, the travel should be made convenient through sustainable transport solutions.  Transportation system all  over the world is facing unprecedented challenges in the current scenario of increased population, urbanization and motorization.  Farewell to all difficulties as reinforcement learning along with deep learning can now make it simpler for consumers.  In this paper we have applied reinforcement learning techniques for a self-driving agent in a simplified world to aid it in effectively reaching its destinations in the allotted time. We have first investigated the environment, the agent operates in, by constructing a very basic driving implementation. Once the agent is successful at operating within the environment, we can then identify each possible state the agent can be in when considering such things as traffic lights and oncoming traffic at each intersection. With states identified, we can implement a Q-Learning algorithm for the self-driving agent to guide the agent towards its destination within the allotted time. Finally, we can improve upon the Q-Learning algorithm to find the best configuration of learning and exploration factors to ensure the self-driving agent is reaching its destinations with consistently positive results.  Our aim is also to find optimum values of parameters of the fitting function alpha, gamma and epsilon, so that the agent can work in an optimized way with the most optimum parameter values. Hence, a comparative analysis has also been conducted.    Methodology used    The solution to the smart cab objective is deep reinforcement learning in a simulated environment. The smart cab operates in an ideal, grid-like city (similar to New York City), with roads going in the North-South and East-West directions. Other vehicles will certainly be present on the road, but there will be no pedestrians to be      concerned with. At each intersection there is a traffic light that either allows traffic in the North-South direction or the East-West direction.  We have assumed that the smart cab is assigned a route plan based on the passengers' starting location and destination. The route is split at each intersection into waypoints, and the smart cab, at any instant, is at some intersection in the world. Therefore, the next waypoint to the destination, assuming the destination has not already been reached, is one intersection away in one direction (North, South, East, or West). The smart cab has only an egocentric view of the intersection it is at: It can determine the state of the traffic light for its direction of movement, and whether there is a vehicle at the intersection for each of the oncoming directions. For each action, the smart cab may either stay idle at the intersection, or drive to the next intersection to the left, right, or ahead of it. Finally, each trip has a time to reach the destination which decreases for each action taken (the passengers want to get there quickly). If the allotted time becomes zero before reaching the destination, the trip has failed. The smart cab will receive positive or negative rewards based on the action it has taken. Expectedly, the smart cab will receive a small positive reward when making a good action, and a varying amount of negative reward dependent on the severity of the traffic violation it would have committed. Based on the rewards and penalties the smart cab receives, the self-driving agent implementation should learn an optimal policy for driving on the city roads while obeying traffic rules, avoiding accidents, and reaching passengers' destinations in the allotted time.  Environment: The smartcab operates in an ideal, grid-like city (similar to New York City), with roads going in the North-South  and East-West directions. Other vehicles will certainly be present on the road, but there will be no pedestrians to be concerned with. At each intersection there is a traffic light that either allows traffic in the North-South direction or the East-West direction. U.S. Right-of-Way rules apply:  ÔÇ∑ On a green light, a left turn is permitted if there is no oncoming traffic making a right turn or coming straight through the intersection. ÔÇ∑ On a red light, a right turn is permitted if no oncoming traffic is approaching from your left through the intersection. To understand how to correctly yield to oncoming traffic when turning left. ",2021-06-03T05:41:44Z,en

181403600,ameyskulkarni/Detection-and-Localization-of-traffic-lights-using-RCNNs-on-Bosch-BSTLD-dataset,"This repository presents a code to detect the rear of cars using RCNNs. The dataset consists of road images in different conditions like daylight and night conditions. The labels are given in the .csv format. Each row of the labels file consists of name of the image, details about coordinates of the bounding box(x_min, x_max, y_min and y_max), and the label itself.  Details are extracted from the csv file and stored in a dataframe. ONly a subset of the data was trained on due to the resource exhaustion. All the details will be given below.  Object detection: There are two parts to object detection-  Object classification Object localization Bounding boxes are used usually for the localization purpose and the labels are used for classification. The two major techniques used in the industry for object detection are RCNNs and YOLO. I have dedicated the time spent on these assignments to learn about one of these techniques: RCNNs.  Region Based Convolutional Neural Networks  The Architecture of RCNN is very extensive as it has different blocks of layes for the above mentioned purposes: classification and localization.  The code I have used takes VGG-16 as the first block of layers which take in the images as 3D tensors and and give out feature maps. To understand the importance of Transfer learning, I have used pre-trained weights of this model. This is the base network.  The next network block is the Region Proposal Network. This is a Fully Convolutional Network. This network uses a concept of Anchors. It is a very interesting concept. This solves the problem of using exactly what length of bounding boxes. The image is scaled down and now each pixel woks as an anchor.  Each anchor defines a certain number of bounding box primitives. The RPN is used to predict the score of object being inside each of this bounding box primitive. A Region of INterest pooling layer appears next. This is a layer which takes in ROIs of the feature map to compare and classify each bounding box.  A post processing technique of Non-maximal supression is used to select the bounding box with the highest probability of the object being there. The image is scaled back up and this box is displayed.  Hyperparameters used- Number of samples for training- 2252 Number of samples for testing- 176 ROIs- 4 epoch length- 500 Epochs- 91 Anchors-9  All results are visible in the ipynb files of training and testing. With only running the 40 epochs the mAP over the test data gave 0.68 value. THis is close to the 75% expected. I trained more and the accuracy visibly improved from the loss graph and the bounding box accuracy but sadly I am not able to find the mAP after this training round because the I increased the dataset size and I always get and error of resource exhaustion. I am planning to make the code more modular so that I can allocate resources to different modules separately and this issue is overcome. The accuarcy can further be improved by training over a larger dataset and running for more epochs. I will try to do this and improve the accuracy.",2021-06-03T13:33:52Z,en

Climate related data is important to analyse agricultural and crop seeding related field, where those data can be used to show the predict the rainfall in different season also for different types of crops. Developed application can be found from http://ml.bigalogy.com/ Paper: http://dspace.uiu.ac.bd/handle/52243/178 Abstract Mankind have been attempting to predict the weather from prehistory. For good reason for knowing when to plant crops, when to build and when to prepare for drought and flood. In a nation such as Bangladesh being able to predict the weather, especially rainfall has never been so vitally important. The proposed research work pursues to produce prediction model on rainfall using the machine learning algorithms. The base data for this work has been collected from Bangladesh Meteorological Department. It is mainly focused on the development of models for long term rainfall prediction of Bangladesh divisions and districts (Weather Stations). Rainfall prediction is very important for the Bangladesh economy and day to day life. Scarcity or heavy - both rainfall effects rural and urban life to a great extent with the changing pattern of the climate. Unusual rainfall and long lasting rainy season is a great factor to take account into. We want to see whether too much unusual behavior is taking place another pattern resulting new clamatorial description. As agriculture is dependent on rain and heavy rainfall caused flood frequently leading to great loss to crops, rainfall is a very complex phenomenon which is dependent on various atmospheric, oceanic and geographical parameters. The relationship between these parameters and rainfall is unstable. Beside this changing behavior of clamatorial facts making the existing meteorological forecasting less usable to the users.  Initially linear regression models were developed for monthly rainfall prediction of station and national level as per day month year. Here humidity, temperatures & wind parameters are used as predictors. The study is further extended by developing another popular regression analysis algorithm named Random Forest Regression. After then, few other classification algorithms have been used for model building, training and prediction. Those are Naive Bayes Classification, Decision Tree Classification (Entropy and Gini) and Random Forest Classification. In all model building and training predictor parameters were Station, Year, Month and Day. As the effect of rainfall affecting parameters is embedded in rainfall, rainfall was the label or dependent variable in these models. The developed and trained model is capable of predicting rainfall in advance for a month of a given year for a given area (for area we used here are the stations (weather parameters values are measured by Bangladesh Meteorological Department). The accuracy of rainfall estimation is above 65%. Accuracy percentage varies from algorithm to algorithm.  Two regression analysis and three classification analysis models has been developed for rainfall prediction of 33 Bangladeshi weather station. Apache Spark library has been used for machine library in Scala programming language. The main idea behind the use of classification and regression analysis is to see the comparative difference between types of algorithms prediction output and the predictability along with usability.  This thesis is a contribution to the effort of rainfall prediction within Bangladesh. It takes the strategy of applying machine learning models to historical weather data gathered in Bangladesh. As part of this work, a web-based software application was written using Apache Spark, Scala and HighCharts to demonstrate rainfall prediction using multiple machine learning models. Models are successively improved with the rainfall prediction accuracy.  Content The given data has weather station and year wise monthly rainfall data of Bangladesh. Data is two format - 46 year (33 Weather Station) : From 1970 to 2016  Daily Rainfall Data  Monthly Rainfall Data Columns:  Station (Weather Station, along with Station Index) Year Month Day [For daily data file]",2021-02-17T15:29:50Z,en

186919823,Jonathandeventer/master-thesis-DCDT,"In recent years, community detection has received increased attention thanks to its wide range of applications in many fields. While at first most techniques were focused on discovering communities in static networks, lately the research community‚Äôs focus has shifted toward methods that can detect meaningful substructures in evolving networks because of their high relevance in real-life problems. This thesis explores the current availability of empirical comparative studies of dynamic methods and also provides its own qualitative and quantitative comparison with the aim of gaining more insight in the performance of available algorithms that are expected to perform well in the context of social community detection. The qualitative comparison includes 13 algorithms, namely D-GT, Extended BGL, TILES, AFOCS, HOCTracker, OLCPM, DOCET, LabelRankT, FacetNet, DYNMOGA, DEMON and iLCD. The empirical analysis compares TILES, HOCTracker, OLCPM, DEMON and iLCD on synthetic RDyn graphs and the real graph, DBLP. In addition to the results of the empirical and qualitative results of the analysis, the thesis‚Äôs value lies in its wide coverage of the dynamic community detection problem.

With the increased use of IoT infrastructure in every domain, threats and attacks in these infrastructures are also growing commensurately. Denial of Service, Data Type Probing, Malicious Control, Malicious Operation, Scan, Spying and Wrong Setup are such attacks and anomalies which can cause an IoT system failure. In this paper, performances of several machine learning models have been compared to predict attacks and anomalies on the IoT systems accurately. The machine learning (ML) algorithms that have been used here are Logistic Regression (LR), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Decision Tree (DT), Random Forest (RF), and Artificial Neural Network (ANN). The evaluation metrics used in the comparison of performance are accuracy, precision, recall, f1 score, and area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve. The system obtained 99.4% test accuracy for Decision Tree, Random Forest, and ANN. Though these techniques have the same accuracy, other metrics prove that Random Forest performs comparatively better.",2021-04-09T05:04:31Z,en

To address these limitations, we investigate a computer vision‚Äêbased approach that employs SIFT keypoint matching on collected images of defects against a pre-existing reconstructed 3D point cloud of the bridge. We also investigate methods of reducing computation time with ML-based and conventional CV methods of segmentation to eliminate redundant keypoints.

Jigsaw sponsored this effort and extended annotation of this data by human raters for various toxic conversational attributes.  In the data supplied for this competition, the text of the individual comment is found in the comment_text column. Each comment in Train has a toxicity label (target), and models should predict the target toxicity for the Test data. This attribute (and all others) are fractional values which represent the fraction of human raters who believed the attribute applied to the given comment. For evaluation, test set examples with target >= 0.5 will be considered to be in the positive class (toxic).  The data also has several additional toxicity subtype attributes. Models do not need to predict these attributes for the competition, they are included as an additional avenue for research. Subtype attributes are:  severe_toxicity obscene threat insult identity_attack sexual_explicit Additionally, a subset of comments have been labelled with a variety of identity attributes, representing the identities that are mentioned in the comment. The columns corresponding to identity attributes are listed below. Only identities with more than 500 examples in the test set (combined public and private) will be included in the evaluation calculation. These identities are shown in bold.  male female transgender other_gender heterosexual homosexual_gay_or_lesbian bisexual other_sexual_orientation christian jewish muslim hindu buddhist atheist other_religion black white asian latino other_race_or_ethnicity physical_disability intellectual_or_learning_disability psychiatric_or_mental_illness other_disability Note that the data contains different comments that can have the exact same text.

Motivated by these advancements, we present a multimodal emotion recognition system which is based on body language, facial expression and speech. This paper presents the techniques used in the Multimodal Emotion Recognition in Polish challenge. To detect the emotional state for various videos, data preprocessing operations are performed and robust features are extracted.

199842680,Garima13a/MNIST_GAN,"In this notebook, we'll be building a generative adversarial network (GAN) trained on the MNIST dataset. From this, we'll be able to generate new handwritten digits!  GANs were first reported on in 2014 from Ian Goodfellow and others in Yoshua Bengio's lab. Since then, GANs have exploded in popularity. Here are a few examples to check out:  Pix2Pix CycleGAN & Pix2Pix in PyTorch, Jun-Yan Zhu A list of generative models The idea behind GANs is that you have two networks, a generator  ùê∫  and a discriminator  ùê∑ , competing against each other. The generator makes ""fake"" data to pass to the discriminator. The discriminator also sees real training data and predicts if the data it's received is real or fake.  The generator is trained to fool the discriminator, it wants to output data that looks as close as possible to real, training data. The discriminator is a classifier that is trained to figure out which data is real and which is fake. What ends up happening is that the generator learns to make data that is indistinguishable from real data to the discriminator.   The general structure of a GAN is shown in the diagram above, using MNIST images as data. The latent sample is a random vector that the generator uses to construct its fake images. This is often called a latent vector and that vector space is called latent space. As the generator trains, it figures out how to map latent vectors to recognizable images that can fool the discriminator.  If you're interested in generating only new images, you can throw out the discriminator after training. In this notebook, I'll show you how to define and train these adversarial networks in PyTorch and generate new images!",2021-05-13T07:39:40Z,en

175754192,superhen/Automated-Job-Resume-Matching-Solution,"According to a 2015 study on job seeking behavior by Pew Research Center, 79% of the job seekers utilized the online resources for their most recent employment (Aaron ,2015). This study result suggests that the online job boards become the major channel for job seekers in the digital era. However, another finding in the study indicates that most of the job seekers fail to match their experiences with the job requirements and spend hours on job board to apply job which is not seen to be suitable (Aaron, 2015). Additionally, Dr. John Sullivan conducted a similar research in 2013 which highlighted some interesting aspects: on average, 250 resumes are received for each job opening by the major organizations, more than 50% of the resumes does not meet the minimum requirement (John, 2013). This means the time our recruiter spends on these 50% of the resumes for each job is wasted. From both candidate and recruiter‚Äôs points of view, the phenomenon may suggest that the traditional online job board does not seem to simplify the job application process or reduce the effort required from both parties. With this challenge getting bigger and bigger, the demand to automate the resume - job matching process is getting increased as well. For instance, the content - based recommendation system (CBR) is introduced to analyze the job description to identify the potential area of interest to the job seekers (Shiqiang et al., 2016). To apply the concept in Singapore local context, our team has conducted a text mining project based on the data acquired from the major online job board in Singapore. The primary objective of this project is to create a machine learning model to accelerate the job - resume matching process. The detail of the text mining methodology and results are presented in the following sections.",2021-05-24T23:23:43Z,en

The knowledge extracting and reusing abilities enable the lifelong machine learning to understand the knowledge for solving a task and obtain the ability to solve the related problems. In sentiment classification, traditional approaches like Na√Øve Bayes focus on the probability for each words with positive or negative sentiment. However, the lifelong machine learning in this paper will investigate this problem in a different angle and attempt to discover which words determine the sentiment of a review. We will pay all attention to obtain knowledge during learning for future learning rather than just solve a current task.",2020-04-13T04:47:16Z,en

This project aims to help make that decision. Vader sentiment analysis was implemented on tweets to compute a daily sentiment score. From historical stock data the difference between Tesla opening price and the prior day‚Äôs closing price was computed and used as the endogenous variable in an ARIMAX time series model with daily sentiment as an exogenous variable.

212749746,mistersharmaa/BreastCancerPrediction,"Breast cancer has the second highest mortality rate in women next to lung cancer. As per clinical statistics, 1 in every 8 women is diagnosed with breast cancer in their lifetime. However, periodic clinical check-ups and self-tests help in early detection and thereby significantly increase the chances of survival. Invasive detection techniques cause rupture of the tumor, accelerating the spread of cancer to adjoining areas. Hence, there arises the need for a more robust, fast, accurate, and efficient non-invasive cancer detection system. Early detection can give patients more treatment options. In order to detect signs of cancer, breast tissue from biopsies is stained to enhance the nuclei and cytoplasm for microscopic examination. Then, pathologists evaluate the extent of any abnormal structural variation to determine whether there are tumors. Architectural Distortion (AD) is a very subtle contraction of the breast tissue and may represent the earliest sign of cancer. Since it is very likely to be unnoticed by radiologists, several approaches have been proposed over the years but none using deep learning techniques. AI will become a transformational force in healthcare and soon, computer vision models will be able to get a higher accuracy when researchers have the access to more medical imaging datasets. The application of machine learning models for prediction and prognosis of disease development has become an irrevocable part of cancer studies aimed at improving the subsequent therapy and management of patients. The application of machine learning models for accurate prediction of survival time in breast cancer on the basis of clinical data is the main objective.  We have developed a computer vision model to detect breast cancer in histopathological images. Two classes will be used in this project: Benign and Malignant",2021-03-29T01:10:06Z,en

Image guided radiation therapy requires the accurate segmentation of organs at risk (OARs). In this paper, we propose a 2D U-Net network to automatically segment thoracic organs at risk in computed tomography (CT) images. The architecture consists of a down sampling path to capture features and a symmetric up sampling path to obtain precise localization. SegTHOR19 is a competition timed to the conference IEEE ISBI 2019 that addresses the problem of organs at risk segmentation in Computed Tomography (CT) images. In the SegTHOR19 challenge, 40 CT scans with 4 thoracic organs (i.e., esophagus, heart, trachea and aorta) were used for training [1]. We experimented with both 2D U-net and 2D U-Net with Resnet18 architecture to train the networks.

The objective of this project is to develop a methodology to statistically combine additional information to obtain a 3D time series sufficiently resolved horizontally and vertically to follow the eddies. It is based on a regression classification method that allows both to classify the temperature profiles and to propose a linear model between the satellite observations and the information of the buoys according to its label.",2021-01-28T11:28:49Z,en

Ideally, after it has collected and summarized the information, I would like to generate a script based on the summaries and hopefully do a weekly online show discussing the happenings and other current events.  Additionally, this is an exercise in for me to learn Cookiecutter, Git, ReadTheDocs, and Travis.CI. I have primarily worked with TFS, SVN, and Jenkins for CI.

221982378,arpit1920/Extractive-Text-Summerization,"Summarization systems often have additional evidence they can utilize in order to specify the most important topics of document(s). For example, when summarizing blogs, there are discussions or comments coming after the blog post that are good sources of information to determine which parts of the blog are critical and interesting. In scientific paper summarization, there is a considerable amount of information such as cited papers and conference information which can be leveraged to identify important sentences in the original paper. How text summarization works In general there are two types of summarization, abstractive and extractive summarization. Abstractive Summarization: Abstractive methods select words based on semantic understanding, even those words did not appear in the source documents. It aims at producing important material in a new way. They interpret and examine the text using advanced natural language techniques in order to generate a new shorter text that conveys the most critical information from the original text. It can be correlated to the way human reads a text article or blog post and then summarizes in their own word. Input document ‚Üí understand context ‚Üí semantics ‚Üí create own summary. 2. Extractive Summarization: Extractive methods attempt to summarize articles by selecting a subset of words that retain the most important points. This approach weights the important part of sentences and uses the same to form the summary. Different algorithm and techniques are used to define weights for the sentences and further rank them based on importance and similarity among each other. Input document ‚Üí sentences similarity ‚Üí weight sentences ‚Üí select sentences with higher rank. The limited study is available for abstractive summarization as it requires a deeper understanding of the text as compared to the extractive approach. Purely extractive summaries often times give better results compared to automatic abstractive summaries. This is because of the fact that abstractive summarization methods cope with problems such as semantic representation, inference and natural language generation which is relatively harder than data-driven approaches such as sentence extraction. There are many techniques available to generate extractive summarization. To keep it simple, I will be using an unsupervised learning approach to find the sentences similarity and rank them. One benefit of this will be, you don‚Äôt need to train and build a model prior start using it for your project. It‚Äôs good to understand Cosine similarity to make the best use of code you are going to see. Cosine similarity is a measure of similarity between two non-zero vectors of an inner product space that measures the cosine of the angle between them. Since we will be representing our sentences as the bunch of vectors, we can use it to find the similarity among sentences. Its measures cosine of the angle between vectors. Angle will be 0 if sentences are similar. All good till now..? Hope so :) Next, Below is our code flow to generate summarize text:- Input article ‚Üí split into sentences ‚Üí remove stop words ‚Üí build a similarity matrix ‚Üí generate rank based on matrix ‚Üí pick top N sentences for summary.",2020-12-23T00:33:46Z,en

The data was obtained at various C-rates for duration of 10 months at one-month intervals. The wininng model, Random Forest (RF), has achieved a R2 score of 99.98% and a mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.14% over test data, confirming the ability of RF to capture input-output dependency.

Today‚Äôs algorithms accomplish tasks that until recently only expert humans could perform. As it relates to finance, this is an exciting time to adopt a disruptive technology that will transform how everyone invests for generations.  Models that explain the returns of individual stocks generally use company and stock characteristics, e.g., the market prices of financial instruments and companies‚Äô accounting data. These characteristics can also be used to predict expected stock returns out-of-sample. Most studies use simple linear models to form these predictions [1] or [2]. An increasing body of academic literature documents that more sophisticated tools from the Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) repertoire, which allow for nonlinear predictor interactions, can improve the stock return forecasts [3], [4] or [5].  The main goal of this project is to investigate whether modern DL techniques can be utilized to more efficiently predict the movements of the stock market. Specifically, we train a LSTM neural network with time series price-volume data and compare its out-of-sample return predictability with the performance of a simple logistic regression (our baseline model).",2021-06-18T22:30:49Z,en

Can we  extract public financial data from sites like moneycontrol.com to find which are the fundamentally strong  stocks. On what stocks would the father of value investing, Benjamin Graham and Warren Buffett the  most successful investors in the world make their investments on. Benjamin Graham and Warren Buffett Model Step 1: Filter out all companies with sales less than Rs 250 cr.  Companies with sales lower than this are very small companies and might not have the business stability  and access to finance that is required for a safe investment. This eliminates the basic business risk.  Step 2: Filter out all companies with debt to equity greater than 30%.  Companies with low leverage are safer.  Step 3: Filter out all companies with interest coverage ratio of less than 4.  Companies with high interest coverage ratio have a highly reduced bankruptcy risk.  Step 4: Filter out all companies with ROE less than 15%  since they are earning less than their cost of capital. High ROE companies have a robust business model,  which generates increased earnings for the company typically.  Step 5: Filter out all companies with PE ratio greater than 25  since they are too expensive even for a high-quality company. This enables us to pick companies which are  relatively cheaper as against their actual value. He points out that applying these filters enables us to  reduce and even eliminate a lot of fundamental risks while ensuring a robust business model, strong  earning potential and a good buying price.

Alzheimer‚Äôs is one of kind and fatal. The early detection of Alzheimer‚Äôs Disease because of it‚Äôs progressive risk and patients all around the world. Early detection of AD is promising as it can help lot of patients to predetermine the condition they may face in future. AD being progressive, can be prevented if detected early. On worse stage, the curing of this disease is very difficult and expensive. So, by analyzing the consequences of AD, we can make use of Artificial intelligence technology by using MRI scanned images to classify the patients if they may or may not have AD in future. Using of Bio-inspired algorithm can maximize the result and accuracy for this purpose. After comparing the results of the various AI technologies, CSA came to be the best approach, using it with ML algorithms. ",2021-06-15T11:19:12Z,en

The data scientist uses distinctive machine learning techniques for modeling health diseases by using authentic dataset eÔ¨Éciently and accurately. The medical analysts are needy for the models or systems to predict the disease in patients before the strike. High cholesterol, unhealthy diet, harmful use of alcohol, high sugar levels, high blood pressure, and smoking are the main symptoms of chances of the heart attack in humans.  Data Science is an advanced and enhanced method for the analysis and encapsulation of useful information. The attributes and variable in the dataset discover an unknown and future state of the model using prediction in machine learning. Chest pain, blood pressure, cholesterol, blood sugar, family history of heart disease, obesity, and physical inactivity are the chances that inÔ¨Çuence the possibility of heart diseases. This project emphasizes to evaluate diÔ¨Äerent algorithms for the diagnosis of heart disease with better accuracies by using the patient‚Äôs data set because predictions and descriptions are fundamental objectives of machine learning. Each procedure has unique perspective for the modeling objectives. Algorithms have been implemented for the prediction of heart disease with our Heart patient data set",2021-06-11T02:46:47Z,en

The first phase of our approach learns high dimensional sentence embeddings from hundreds of thousands of descriptions extracted from software vulnerabilities listed in the CVE database and issue descriptions extracted from open source projects using an unsupervised learning process. The second phase then utilizes this semantic ontology of embeddings to train a deep convolutional neural network capable of predicting whether a given issue contains security- related information.",2021-04-15T10:58:57Z,en

The course follows a modern-teaching approach where students learn by doing. You will start Python from scratch by first creating simple programs. Once you learn the basics you will then be guided on how to create 10 real-world complex applications in Python 3 through easy video explanations and support by the course instructor. Some of the applications you will build during the course are database web apps, desktop apps, web scraping scripts, webcam object detectors, web maps, and more. These programs are not only great examples to master Python, you can also use any of them as a portfolio once you have built them.  By buying the course you will gain lifetime access to all its videos, coding exercises, quizzes, code notebooks, and the Q&A inside the course where you can ask your questions and get an answer the same day. On top of that you are covered by the Udemy 30-day money back guarantee, so you can easily return the course if you don't like it.  If you don't know anything about Python, do not worry! In the first two sections, you will learn Python basics such as functions, loops, and conditionals. If you already know the basics, then the first two sections can serve as a refresher. The other 22 sections focus entirely on building real-world applications. The applications you will build cover a wide range of interesting topics:  Web applications   Desktop applications   Database applications   Web scraping   Web mapping   Data analysis  Data visualization  Computer vision  Object-Oriented Programming  Specifically, the 10 Python applications you will build are:  A program that returns English-word definitions  A program that blocks access to distracting websites   A web map visualizing volcanoes and population data  A portfolio website  A desktop-graphical program with a database backend  A webcam motion detector  A web scraper of real estate data  An interactive web graph  A database web application  A web service that converts addresses to geographic coordinates  To consider yourself a professional programmer you need to know how to make professional programs and there's no other course that teaches you that, so join thousands of other students who have successfully applied their Python skills in the real world.

For Fewer Data Classical Machine Learning Models are said to outstand given the data is pre-processed well. On the same theory here is my approach for Detecting whether a plant leaf is healthy or unhealthy by utilizing the classical Machine Learning Models, Pre-processing the Image Data.  The data was fed to 7 Machine Learning Models with 10 fold cross-validation out of which Random Forest Classifier outperformed all the other models giving an accuracy of 97% on the test set.",2021-06-10T22:24:45Z,en

194400702,reddyprasade/Machine-Learning-with-Scikit-Learn-Python-3.x,"In general, a learning problem considers a set of n samples of data and then tries to predict properties of unknown data. If each sample is more than a single number and, for instance, a multi-dimensional entry (aka multivariate data), it is said to have several attributes or features.  Learning problems fall into a few categories:  supervised learning, in which the data comes with additional attributes that we want to predict (Click here to go to the scikit-learn supervised learning page).This problem can be either:  classification: samples belong to two or more classes and we want to learn from already labeled data how to predict the class of unlabeled data. An example of a classification problem would be handwritten digit recognition, in which the aim is to assign each input vector to one of a finite number of discrete categories. Another way to think of classification is as a discrete (as opposed to continuous) form of supervised learning where one has a limited number of categories and for each of the n samples provided, one is to try to label them with the correct category or class.  regression: if the desired output consists of one or more continuous variables, then the task is called regression. An example of a regression problem would be the prediction of the length of a salmon as a function of its age and weight.  unsupervised learning, in which the training data consists of a set of input vectors x without any corresponding target values. The goal in such problems may be to discover groups of similar examples within the data, where it is called clustering, or to determine the distribution of data within the input space, known as density estimation, or to project the data from a high-dimensional space down to two or three dimensions for the purpose of visualization (Click here to go to the Scikit-Learn unsupervised learning page).",2021-06-16T16:06:09Z,en
