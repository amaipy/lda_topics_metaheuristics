This long standing ill-posed problem is crucial to numerous applications such as robot navigation, object recognition and scene understanding, medical diagnosis, and 3D modeling and animatio n. The advancement of deep learning techniques and the increasing availability of large 3D training data sets, have lead to a new generatio n of 3D shape inference methods that are able to predict the 3D geometry and structure of objects from a single view. In this work, we have experimented on different output representations, i.e. voxel, mesh, and point cloud, and two coordinate systems, commonly known as object-centered and viewer-centered. We have developed an end-to-end learning framework with Variational Autoencoder network, where the recognition network maps both the input image and silhouette, autogenerated using U-Net, to a latent representation and the generative network is expected to perform non-trivial reasoning about the 3D structure of the object, which we tried on chair category of ShapeNet dataset and achieved a comparable result to the state of the art",object 3d,6.0,ml_related

In contrast, neural network models for natural language modeling fail when such compositional generalization is required. The main contribution of this paper is to hypothesize that language compositionality is a form of group-equivariance. Based on this hypothesis, we propose a set of tools for constructing equivariant sequence-to-sequence models. Throughout a variety of experiments on the SCAN tasks, we analyze the behavior of existing models under the lens of equivariance, and demonstrate that our equivariant architecture is able to achieve the type compositional generalization required in human language understanding.",compositional generalization require equivariant equivariance,12.0,tool

It was first identified in December 2019 in Wuhan, China, and has since spread globally, resulting in an ongoing pandemic. Long Short Term Memories(LSTMs) can solve numerous tasks not solvable by previous learning algorithms for recurrent neural networks (RNNs). LSTM is applicable to tasks such as unsegmented, connected handwriting recognition, speech recognition and anomaly detection in network traffic or IDS's (intrusion detection systems). LSTMs can also be efficiently applied for time-series predictions. In this project, its shows a four stacked LSTM network for early prediction  new Coronavirus dissease infections in some of the mentioned  affected countries (India, USA, Czech Republic and Russia) , which is based on real world data sets which are analyzed using various perspectives like day-wise number of confirmed cases, number of Cured cases, death cases.

Using a convolutional encoder-decoder based architecture, we show that a well trained neural network can learn spatio-temporal traffic speed dynamics from timespace diagrams. We demonstrate this for a homogeneous road section using simulated vehicle trajectories and then validate it using real-world data from NGSIM. Our results show that with probe vehicle penetration levels as low as 5%, the proposed estimation method can provide a sound reconstruction of macroscopic traffic speeds and reproduce realistic shockwave patterns, implying applicability in a variety of traffic conditions. We further discuss the model’s reconstruction mechanisms and confirm its ability to differentiate various traffic behaviors such as congested and free-flow traffic states, transition dynamics, and shockwave propagation.",vehicle traffic speed shockwave,12.0,tool

yj4889/yj4889-Optimized-Quantization-for-Convolutional-Deep-Neural-Networks-in-Federated-Learning,"Federated learning is a distributed learning method that trains a deep network on user devices without collecting data from central server. It is useful when the central server can’t collect data. However, the absence of data on central server means that deep network compression using data is not possible. Deep network compression is very important because it enables inference even on device with low capacity. In this paper, we proposed a new quantization method that significantly reduces FPROPS(floating-point operations per second) in deep networks without leaking user data in federated learning. Quantization parameters are trained by general learning loss, and updated simultaneously with weight. We call this method as OQFL(Optimized Quantization in Federated Learning). OQFL is a method of learning deep networks and quantization while maintaining security in a distributed network environment including edge computing. We introduce the OQFL method and simulate it in various Convolutional deep neural networks. We shows that OQFL is possible in most representative convolutional deep neural network. Surprisingly, OQFL(4bits) can preserve the accuracy of conventional federated learning(32bits) in test dataset. ",network deep quantization method central oqfl,3.0,tool

For this to be a success, the vehicle should be safe, reliable and provide a comfortable user experience. Autonomous driving must have sophisticated negotiating skills while taking right, left turns and while pushing ahead in urban areas. Reinforcement learning is considered as the main domain for learning driving policy. We propose a reinforcement learning approach using deep Q-learning approach which will extract the maximum reward from a large state space. We use CARLA, an open-source simulator for autonomous driving research.

ronitkathuria15/handwritten-prescription-recognition,"The Optical Character Recognition (OCR) system consists of a comprehensive neural network built using Python and TensorFlow that was trained on over 115,000 wordimages from the IAM On-Line Handwriting Database (IAM-OnDB). The neural network consists of 5 Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) layers, 2 Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) Layers, and a final Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC) layer. As the input image is fed into the CNN layers, a non-linear ReLU function is applied to extract relevant features from the image. The ReLU function is preferred due to the lower likelihood of a vanishing gradient (which arises when network parameters and hyperparameters are not properly set) relative to a sigmoid function. In the case of the RNN layers, the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) implementation is used due to its ability to propagate information through long distances. The CTC is given the RNN output matrix and the ground truth text to compute the loss value and the mean of the loss values of the batch elements is used to train the OCR system. This means is fed into an RMSProp optimizer which is focused on minimizing the loss, and it does so in a very robust manner. For inference, the CTC layer decodes the RNN output matrix into the final text. The OCR system reports an accuracy rate of 95.7% for the IAM Test Dataset, but this accuracy falls to 89.4% for unseen handwritten doctors’ prescriptions. ",rnn layer ocr ctc iam,2.0,ml_related

aaqibmehrban/MASCALOGICS-Automatic-Reddit-text-to-Video-Generator-and-youtube-uploader,"You would have noticed alot of channel getting popular on YouTube just by uploading “Reddit to Text-To-Speech” YouTube Videos. So I decided to create a program that can automate the process of receiving, generating and uploading these videos to YouTube with as little intervention as possible. It took me one month to complete this project. I divided the project to 3 scripts.  The idea was to minimize as much manual intervention as possible and automate all the trivial tasks. However the process cannot be 100% automated. For example comments with links in them cannot be kept as quality of the video will be comprised due to the TTS. Additionally while a comment might have a large number of votes it could potentially be offensive and not safe for a YouTube video and thus must be removed. The thumbnail, while partially generated, must be edited in order to create any kind of appeal to viewers to click on your video. The same goes for the title of the video which must be clickbait-y in order to receive any attention. I have attempted to streamline the manual process with the client program and it takes me approximately 30 minutes to create 6 videos (the max that can be uploaded within 24 hours with the YouTube Data API).",video youtube automate process receive manual intervention,11.0,ml_related

AntoinePlumerault/Controlling-generative-models-with-continuous-factors-of-variations,"Recent deep generative models are able to provide photo-realistic images as well as visual or textual content embeddings useful to address various tasks of computer vision and natural language processing. Their usefulness is nevertheless often limited by the lack of control over the generative process or the poor understanding of the learned representation. To overcome these major issues, very recent work has shown the interest of studying the semantics of the latent space of generative models. In this paper, we propose to advance on the interpretability of the latent space of generative models by introducing a new method to find meaningful directions in the latent space of any generative model along which we can move to control precisely specific properties of the generated image like the position or scale of the object in the image. Our method does not require human annotations and is particularly well suited for the search of directions encoding simple transformations of the generated image, such as translation, zoom or color variations. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method qualitatively and quantitatively, both for GANs and variational auto-encoders.",generative_model method direction latent_space,3.0,tool

We show that the hidden activation values contain information useful to distinguish between normal and anomalous samples. Our approach combines three neural networks in a purely data-driven end-to-end model. Based on the activation values in the target network, the alarm network decides if the given sample is normal. Thanks to the anomaly network, our method even works in strict semi-supervised settings. Strong anomaly detection results are achieved on common data sets surpassing current baseline methods. Our semi-supervised anomaly detection method allows to inspect large amounts of data for anomalies across various applications.",anomaly_detection semi_supervised anomaly method activation normal,3.0,tool

A different model is trained for every number of possible speakers, and the model with the largest number of speakers is employed to select the actual number of speakers in a given sample.

The proposed model is based on an encoder-decoder architecture with skip-connections. It is optimized on both time and frequency domains, using multiple loss functions. Empirical evidence shows that it is capable of removing various kinds of background noise including stationary and non-stationary noises, as well as room reverb. Additionally, we suggest a set of data augmentation techniques applied directly on the raw waveform which further improve model performance and its generalization abilities.",real_time noise domain speech_enhancement waveform stationary,2.0,ml_related

bmartacho/UniPose,"We  propose  UniPose,  a  unified  framework  for  human pose estimation,  based on our “Waterfall” Atrous Spatial Pooling  architecture,  that  achieves  state-of-art-results  on several pose estimation metrics.   Current pose estimation methods utilizing standard CNN architectures heavily rely on statistical postprocessing or predefined anchor poses for joint  localization.    UniPose  incorporates  contextual  seg- mentation and joint localization to estimate the human pose in  a  single  stage,  with  high  accuracy,  without  relying  on statistical postprocessing methods.   The Waterfall module in  UniPose  leverages  the  efficiency  of  progressive  filter- ing  in  the  cascade  architecture,  while  maintaining  multi- scale fields-of-view comparable to spatial pyramid config- urations. Additionally, our method is extended to UniPose- LSTM for multi-frame processing and achieves state-of-the- art results for temporal pose estimation in Video.  Our re- sults on multiple datasets demonstrate that UniPose,  with a ResNet backbone and Waterfall module, is a robust and efficient architecture for pose estimation obtaining state-of- the-art results in single person pose detection for both sin- gle images and videos.",architecture pose_estimation unipose waterfall,28.0,ml_related

NILM can be formulated as regression problem or most often as a classification problem. Most datasets gathered by smart meters allow to define naturally a regression problem, but the corresponding classification problem is a derived one, since it requires a conversion from the power signal to the status of each device by a thresholding method. We treat three different thresholding methods to perform this task, discussing their differences on various devices from the UK-DALE dataset. We analyze the performance of deep learning state-of-the-art architectures on both the regression and classification problems, introducing criteria to select the most convenient thresholding method.",problem regression nilm thresholding,11.0,ml_related

It also supports IPv6/ICMPv6 protocols with SLAAC address configuration. It operates as user space program attached to Linux TAP interface. As of today stack is able to send and receive traffic over Internet using IPv4 and IPv6 default gateways for routing. Since goal of this project is purely educational (at least at this point) the clarity of code is preferred over its efficiency. For the same reason security features are not being implemented just yet unless they are integral part of TCP/IP suite protocols specification.,ip tcp stack ipv6,3.0,tool

lehommee/DPDnet-A-robust-people-detector-using-deep-learning-with-an-overhead-depth-camera,"This paper proposes a deep learning-based method to detect multiple people from a single overhead depth image with high precision. Our neural network, called DPDnet, is composed by two fully-convolutional encoder-decoder blocks built with residual layers. The main block takes a depth image as input and generates a pixel-wise confidence map, where each detected person in the image is represented by a Gaussian-like distribution, The refinement block combines the depth image and the output from the main block, to refine the confidence map. Both blocks are simultaneously trained end-to-end using depth images and ground truth head position labels. The paper provides a rigorous experimental comparison with some of the best methods of the state-of-the-art, being exhaustively evaluated in different publicly available datasets. DPDnet proves to outperform all the evaluated methods with statistically significant differences, and with accuracies that exceed 99%. The system was trained on one of the datasets (generated by the authors and available to the scientific community) and evaluated in the others without retraining, proving also to achieve high accuracy with varying datasets and experimental conditions.

geeekpi/upsplus,"UPS Plus is a new generation of UPS power management module. It is an improved version of the original UPS prototype. It has been fixed the bug that UPS could not charge and automatically power off during work time. It can not only perform good battery power management, but also provide stable voltage output and RTC functions. At the same time,it support for FCP, AFC, SFCP fast charge protocol, support BC1.2 charging protocol, support battery terminal current/voltage monitoring and support two-way monitoring of charge and discharge. It can provide programmable PVD function. Power Voltage Detector (PVD) can be used to detect if batteries voltage is below or above configured voltage. Once this function has been enabled, it will monitoring your batteries voltage, and you can control whether or not shut down Raspberry Pi via simple bash script or python script. This function will protect your batteries from damage caused by excessive discharge. It can provide Adjustable data sampling Rate. This function allows you to adjust the data sampling rate so that you can get more detailed battery information and also it will consume some power. The data sampling information can communicate with the upper computer device through the I2C protocol. UPS Plus supports the OTA firmware upgrade function. Once there is a new firmware update, it is very convenient for you to upgrade firmware for UPS Plus. The firmware upgrade can be completed only by connecting to the Internet,and execute a python script. Support battery temperature monitoring and power-down memory function. UPS Plus can be set to automatically start the Raspberry Pi after the external power comes on. The programmable shutdown and forced restart function will provide you with a remote power-off restart management method. That means you don’t need to go Unplug the power cable or press the power button to cut off the power again. You can set the program to disconnect the power supply after a few seconds after the Raspberry Pi is shut down properly. And you can also reconnect the power supply after a forced power failure to achieve a remote power-off and restart operation. Once it was setting up, you don't need to press power button to boot up your device which is very suitable for smart home application scenarios.",battery function power voltage,21.0,ml_related
