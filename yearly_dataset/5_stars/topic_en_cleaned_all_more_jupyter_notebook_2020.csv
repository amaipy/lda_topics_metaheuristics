Traditionally, phishing website detection is done through the usage of blacklist databases. However, due to the current, rapid development of global networking and communication technologies, there are numerous websites and it has become difficult to classify based on traditional methods since new websites are created every second. In this paper, we are proposing a real-time, anti-phishing system. In the first step, we extract the lexical and host-based properties of a website. In the second step, we combine URL (Uniform Resource Locator) features, NLP and host-based properties to train the machine learning and deep learning models. Our detection model is able to detect phishing URLs with a detection rate of 94.89%.",website phishe property url,18.0,others

AgHarsh/Fault-Detection-in-Power-Microgrid,"This project presents the concept of fault detection and location in a Power Microgrid making use of the machine learning concepts like Artificial Neural Network. The electronic equipment used in microgrids is in essential need of more secure protection against short circuit faults. Due to the high current at the time of fault occurrence, the whole system might be de-energized which would have a severely negative impact on the entire system. A fault occurs when two or more conductors come in contact with each other or ground. Ground faults are considered as one of the main problems in power systems and account for more than 80% of all faults. An effective method to detect, isolate, and protect the power microgrid system against the effects of short circuit faults is extremely important. In this project we worked on a highly effective new method to protect the microgrid system using an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) that will detect and find the location of the fault before it affects other parts of the system. It would, therefore, be more dependable for microgrid protection. This protection network is distributed all along the power microgrid system protecting the entire microgrid network and is connected to the other protective devices in the system. This project focuses on detecting faults and identifying the location of the faults on electric power transmission lines in the power microgrid network.",power fault microgrid protection,4.0,others

rabia174/COVID-19-Deep-Learning-CNN-Model,"Here, I created my own deep learning(CNN) model for early detection of COVID-19 from chest x-ray images. If we were to answer the question that why we need a deep learning model for early detection of COVID-19 from chest x-ray images, we can say the followings, doctors have seen that even if the test kits desined for diagnosis results in negative, the real results are positive for some patients when they review the chest X-ray images. For now the public dataset contains less amount of data which you can see in the dataset2 folder. We get this dataset from open-source https://github.com/ieee8023/covid-chestxray-dataset, but for sure it is not enough to train a proper deep learning model. But just to show that how easy it is to create an AI for the early detection of these kind of viruses. Just keep in mind that this cannot be used for diagnosis without training many more images in high-resolution and professinal medical tests. There you go! Let's work together to fight against COVID-19. As a tool, I used Keras with Tensorflow background, and the model can be improved by addig more convolution and pooling layers, and increasing the number of feature detectors'.

ramos-iyer/Comparison-of-Hybrid-Neural-Network-Methodologies-for-Sentiment-Emotion-Analysis,"Twitter tweets play an important role in every organisation. This project is based on analysing the English tweets and categorizing the tweets based on the sentiment and emotions of the user. The literature survey conducted showed promising results of using hybrid methodologies for sentiment and emotion analysis. Four different hybrid methodologies have been used for analysing the tweets belonging to various categories. A combination of classification and regression approaches using different deep learning models such as Bidirectional LSTM, LSTM and Convolutional neural network (CNN) are implemented to perform sentiment and behaviour analysis of the tweets. A novel approach of combining Vader and NRC lexicon is used to generate the sentiment and emotion polarity and categories. The evaluation metrics such as accuracy, mean absolute error and mean square error are used to test the performance of the model.  The business use cases for the models applied here can be to understand the opinion of customers towards their business to improve their service. Contradictory to the suggestions of Google‚Äôs S/W ratio method, LSTM models performed better than using CNN models for categorical as well as regression problems.",emotion tweet sentiment,9.0,classification

abhishekpatel-lpu/CICIDS-2017-intrution-detection-,"Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) and Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPSs) are the most important defense tools against the sophisticated and ever-growing network attacks. Due to the lack of reliable test and validation datasets, anomaly-based intrusion detection approaches are suffering from consistent and accurate performance evolutions.  Our evaluations of the existing eleven datasets since 1998 show that most are out of date and unreliable. Some of these datasets suffer from the lack of traffic diversity and volumes, some do not cover the variety of known attacks, while others anonymize packet payload data, which cannot reflect the current trends. Some are also lacking feature set and metadata.  CICIDS2017 dataset contains benign and the most up-to-date common attacks, which resembles the true real-world data (PCAPs). It also includes the results of the network traffic analysis using CICFlowMeter with labeled flows based on the time stamp, source, and destination IPs, source and destination ports, protocols and attack (CSV files). Also available is the extracted features definition.  Generating realistic background traffic was our top priority in building this dataset. We have used our proposed B-Profile system (Sharafaldin, et al. 2016) to profile the abstract behavior of human interactions and generates naturalistic benign background traffic. For this dataset, we built the abstract behaviour of 25 users based on the HTTP, HTTPS, FTP, SSH, and email protocols.  The data capturing period started at 9 a.m., Monday, July 3, 2017 and ended at 5 p.m. on Friday July 7, 2017, for a total of 5 days. Monday is the normal day and only includes the benign traffic. The implemented attacks include Brute Force FTP, Brute Force SSH, DoS, Heartbleed, Web Attack, Infiltration, Botnet and DDoS. They have been executed both morning and afternoon on Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday and Friday.",attack traffic benign lack,28.0,classification

Steganography is what you need! It is one of the techniques of encryption and over the years, steganography has been used to encode a lower resolution image into a higher resolution image. But steganography using naive methods, like LSB manipulation, is susceptible to statistical analysis. Our model extends existing deep learning research for encoding multiple secret images onto a single cover by leveraging convolutional neural networks based deep learning architectures. DeepSteg allows senders to embed up to three secret images onto a single cover using an encoder network and then have multiple decoder networks to obtain the embedded secrets.",image exchange message secret steganography,9.0,classification

In our model, we try to imbibe this approach by fusing the 3 modalities i.e. word context, audio, and video and predict an output regarding the mental health of the patient. The output is divided into a binary yes/no denoting whether the patient has symptoms of depression. We‚Äôve built a deep learning model that fuses these 3 modalities, assigning them appropriate weights, and thus gives an output.",output patient depression fuse mental modality,9.0,classification
