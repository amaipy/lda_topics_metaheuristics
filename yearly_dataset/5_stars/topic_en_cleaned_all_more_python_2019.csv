salmansust/Machine-Learning-TSF-Petroleum-Production,"Time series forecasting (TSF) is the task of predicting future values of a given sequence using historical data. Recently, this task has attracted the attention of researchers in the area of machine learning to address the limitations of traditional forecasting methods, which are time-consuming and full of complexity. With the increasing availability of extensive amounts of historical data along with the need of performing accurate production forecasting, particularly a powerful forecasting technique infers the stochastic dependency between past and future values is highly needed. In this research, we applied machine learning approach capable to address the limitations of traditional forecasting approaches and show accurate predictions and showed comparison of different machine learning models. For evaluation purpose, a case study from the petroleum industry domain is carried out using the production data of an actual gas field of Bangladesh. Toward a fair evaluation, the performance of the models were evaluated by measuring the goodness of fit through the coefficient of determination (R2 ) and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), Mean Squared Error (MSE) , Mean Absolute Error(MAE) and model Accuracy",forecasting error limitation,14.0,tool

chs74515/PeopleCounter,"In present days, people detection, tracking and counting is an important aspect in the video investigation and subjection demand in Computer Vision Systems. Providing (real time) traffic information will help improve and reduce pedestrian and vehicle traffic, especially when the data collected is learned and analyzed over a period of time, which makes its highly essential to identify people, vehicles and objects in general and also accurately counting the number of people and/or vehicles entering and leaving a particular location in real time. To perform people counting, a robust and efficient system is needed. This research is aimed at making a pedestrian traffic reporting system for certain areas and buildings around the campus to potentially help ease traffic circulation. Providing this information will be done through a developed application, which includes image processing with Open Computer Vision (OpenCV). This will show the amount of traffic in certain buildings or area over a period of time.  OpenCV is a cross-platform library which can be used to develop real-time Computer Vision applications [Opencv, 2015b]. It is mainly focused on image processing, video capture and analysis including features like people and object detection. The operations performed were based on the performance and accuracy of the tracking algorithms when implemented in embedded devices such as the Raspberry Pi and the Tinker Board. The Pi Camera was used for real time vision and hosted on the embedded device.  The proposed method used was conjoined with an open-source visual tracking implementation from the contribution branch of the OpenCV library and a unique technique for people detection along with different Filtering Algorithms for tracking this. The programming language of choice to implement these features (Tracking and Detection) is python and its libraries. The present work describes a standalone people counting application designed using Python OpenCV and tested on embedded devices ranging from the Raspberry Pi3 to a Tinker Board and a compatible Camera. All these were used in prototyping the design of this application.  The results reported and showed that the Person-Counter system developed counted the number of people entering the designated area (down), and the number of people leaving (up).",opencv traffic people,0.0,tool

To understand what this may mean, researchers have voiced a continuous desire to study how people currently converse with search engines. Traditionally, the desire to produce such a comprehensive dataset has been limited because those who have this data (Search Engines) have a responsibility to their users to maintain their privacy and cannot share the data publicly in a way that upholds the trusts users have in the Search Engines. Given these two powerful forces we believe we have a dataset and paradigm that meets both sets of needs: A artificial public dataset that approximates the true data and an ability to evaluate model performance on the real user behavior. What this means is we released a public dataset which is generated by creating artificial sessions using embedding similarity and will test on the original data. To say this again: we are not releasing any private user data but are releasing what we believe to be a good representation of true user interactions.",release user data dataset artificial search_engine desire true,7.0,tool

Here I have used the video of France VS Belgium match.So for further detection, I have used the color of their jersy to segment them.For france We will detect the blue jersy and then for belgium we will detect the red jersy.   Algorithm: First we will read the video. Detect the Green ground. Use morphological operation for better detection. Find contours. Detect players. Segment them by France or Belgium. Detect the football.  You can see the code in player_detection.py and the video used is cutvideo.mp4.",detect detection player green ground france belgium jersy,15.0,ml_related

Sission/Coupled-VAE-Improved-Robustness-and-Accuracy-of-a-Variational-Autoencoder,"We present a coupled Variational Auto-Encoder (VAE) method that improves the accuracy and robustness of the probabilistic inferences on represented data. The new method models the dependency between input feature vectors (images) and weighs the outliers with a higher penalty by generalizing the original loss function to the coupled entropy function, using the principles of nonlinear statistical coupling. We evaluate the performance of the coupled VAE model using the MNIST dataset. Compared with the traditional VAE algorithm, the output images generated by the coupled VAE method are clearer and less blurry. The visualization of the input images embedded in 2D latent variable space provides a deeper insight into the structure of new model with coupled loss function: the latent variable has a smaller deviation and the output values are generated by a more compact latent space. We analyze the histograms of probabilities for the input images using the generalized mean metrics, in which increased geometric mean illustrates that the average likelihood of input data is improved. Increases in the -2/3 mean, which is sensitive to outliers, indicates improved robustness. The decisiveness, measured by the arithmetic mean of the likelihoods, is unchanged and -2/3 mean shows that the new model has better robustness.",input robustness vae couple outlier,2.0,ml_related

The adopted dataset was acquired by using Kinect and consist of 360 3D representation of human faces. More precisely, 20 different users performed 6 specific facial expressions (happy, sad, scared, angry, disgusted, surprised) by using 3 emphasis degree (low, medium, high). The collected dataset was labelled and then modelled in a three-dimensional tensor. Then, a multilinear dimensionality reduction technique (Higher-order singular value decomposition - HOSVD) was applied to separately extract the face deformation features related to the shape units and the action units. These specific features are finally exploited to independently rebuild the user human face by using much fewer data with respect to the starting dataset, specifically the 83% less, maintaining approximately 90% of variance.",face unit,0.0,tool

microsoft/OpenKP,"Automatically extracting keyphrases that are salient to the document meanings is an essential step to semantic document understanding. An effective keyphrase extraction (KPE) system can benefit a wide range of natural language processing and information retrieval tasks. Recent neural methods formulate the task as a document-to-keyphrase sequence-to-sequence task. These seq2seq learning models have shown promising results compared to previous KPE systems The recent progress in neural KPE is mostly observed in documents originating from the scientific domain. In real-world scenarios, most potential applications of KPE deal with diverse documents originating from sparse sources. These documents are unlikely to include the structure, prose and be as well written as scientific papers. They often include a much diverse document structure and reside in various domains whose contents target much wider audiences than scientists. To encourage the research community to develop a powerful neural model with key phrase extraction on open domains we have created OpenKP: a dataset of over 150,000 documents with the most relevant keyphrases generated by expert annotation.",document keyphrase originate kpe,16.0,tool

vmarpadge/Parkinsons-Detection-Using-Machine-Learning,"Parkinson’s disease can be detected using speech. The phonation is the most affected in speech i.e. the sound when we pronounce the vowels. We have used the database of the speech samples containing the phonation from the affected and healthy people. Various database of the speech sample is available from JASA (Journal of Acoustic Society of America), UCI. Speech signals or the voice samples have been taken from the standard UCI voice dataset which consists of voice samples of people. The samples of healthy people are also collected for the comparative study. The Test data belongs to 56 subjects. During the collection of this dataset, 56 people are asked to say only the sustained vowels 'a' and 'o' three times respectively. Total of 336 recordings are obtained from the repository. In the training phase the pre-processing of these signals is done for feature extraction by PRAAT software. The features extracted are jitter, shimmer, NHR, HNR, mean and median pitch, number of pulses and periods, minimum and maximum period, SD, SD of period, number and degree of voice breaks. All these features differ from patient to patient depending upon the fact how much Parkinson’s disease has progressed. After extracting all the features we will do dimensionality reduction of the features using particle swarm optimization(PSO),In this optimization method it works like swarm particle and reduce the features selection to a minimum, optimization involves in achieving better result in less computation, after selection of the features, The features are used to train the SVM classifier and the model is  trained.",voice feature people speech period phonation vowel,0.0,tool

We will include voice feature for more interactivity to the user. By utilizing NLP, developers can organize and structure knowledge to perform tasks such as automatic summarization, translation, named entity recognition, relationship extraction, sentiment analysis, speech recognition, and topic segmentation. NLTK has been called “a wonderful tool for teaching and working in, computational linguistics using Python,” and “an amazing library to play with natural language.The main issue with text data is that it is all in text format (strings). However, the Machine learning algorithms need some sort of numerical feature vector in order to perform the task. So before we start with any NLP project we need to pre-process it to make it ideal for working. Converting the entire text into uppercase or lowercase, so that the algorithm does not treat the same words in different cases as different Tokenization is just the term used to describe the process of converting the normal text strings into a list of tokens i.e words that we actually want. Sentence tokenizer can be used to find the list of sentences and Word tokenizer can be used to find the list of words in strings.Removing Noise i.e everything that isn’t in a standard number or letter.Removing Stop words. Sometimes, some extremely common words which would appear to be of little value in helping select documents matching a user need are excluded from the vocabulary entirely. These words are called stop words.Stemming is the process of reducing inflected (or sometimes derived) words to their stem, base or root form — generally a written word form. Example if we were to stem the following words: “Stems”, “Stemming”, “Stemmed”, “and Stemtization”, the result would be a single word “stem”. A slight variant of stemming is lemmatization. The major difference between these is, that, stemming can often create non-existent words, whereas lemmas are actual words. So, your root stem, meaning the word you end up with, is not something you can just look up in a dictionary, but you can look up a lemma. Examples of Lemmatization are that “run” is a base form for words like “running” or “ran” or that the word “better” and “good” are in the same lemma so they are considered the same.",word stem,27.0,tool

The indicator is constructed by applying Kernel Principal Component Analysis to consumption-related Google Trends search categories. The predictive performance of the indicator is evaluated in relation to two conventional survey-based indicators: the Conference Board Consumer Confidence Index and the University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment Index. The findings suggest that in both in-sample and out-of-sample nowcasting estimations the Google indicator performs better than survey-based predictors. The results also demonstrate that the predictive performance of survey-augmented models is no different than the power of a baseline autoregressive model that includes macroeconomic variables as controls. The results demonstrate an enormous potential of Google Trends data as a tool of unmatched value to forecasters of private consumption.,google trend indicator consumption consumer survey,10.0,ml_related

radhe-raman-tiwari/Rice-crop-Insects-and-Weed-Detection-using-faster-R-CNN,As the increase in the world population the demand of the rice is also increases. In order to increase the growth of rice in the rice crop it is necessary to detect the weed and insects in the rice crop to minimize the growth of weed and insects so that the growth of the rice can be increased.Insect and Weed detection is the important factor to be analyzed. Unmanned Air Vehicle (UAV) is used for data acquisition of rice crop in different phases and states so that high quality of RGB images can be captured. In which we have taken 15 different types of rice crop insects species images and different phases of weed images to train the model. The proposed method facilitates the extraction of weed and insects into the rice crop ﬁeld using deep learning concept faster region-based convolutional neural networks(Faster R-CNNs) it is implemented using Python3 with the help of Tensorﬂow API. The result shows that Faster R-CNN method is the state of arts method for detection and classiﬁcation of weed and insects with good accuracy rate.,weed crop rice insect,25.0,tool

Due to the non-stationary property of audio signals and lack of powerful tools, audio hiding in images was not explored well. We devised a deep generative model that consists of an auto-encoder as generator along with one discriminator that are trained to embed the message while, an exclusive extractor network with an audio discriminator is trained fundamentally to extract the hidden message from the encoded host signal. The encoded image is subjected to few common attacks and it is established that the message signal can not be hindered making the proposed method robust towards blurring, rotation, noise, and cropping. The one remarkable feature of our method is that it can be trained to recover against various attacks and hence can also be used for watermarking.",hide message train signal audio discriminator,0.0,tool
